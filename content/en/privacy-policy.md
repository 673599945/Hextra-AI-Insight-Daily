# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy lays out our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information when you use our Service. It also spills the tea on your privacy rights and how the law protects you. 🔐

We tap into your personal data to keep our Service running smoothly and constantly make it better for you. By using the Service, you're essentially giving us the green light to collect and use your info just as we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. 👍

## Let's Talk Terms & Definitions

### Word Up! (Interpretation)
Okay, so you'll spot some capitalized words chilling in this doc. 👇 Those words have specific meanings, and we've defined them right here. And hey, whether they're singular or plural, they still mean the same thing – no funny business!

### The Nitty-Gritty Definitions
For the sake of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account**: This is your unique spot, set up just for you to get into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate**: Think of this as a company that's either calling the shots, being called the shots by, or sharing the shots with another company. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the voting power (shares, equity, etc.).

- **Company**: When we say "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement, we're talking about **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies**: These are just tiny files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or whatever device you're using. They hold bits of info, like your browsing history on that site, among other things.

- **Country**: For us, that means California, USA. 🇺🇸

- **Device**: Basically, any gadget you use to get to our Service – could be your computer, phone, or even that trusty tablet.

- **Personal Data**: This is any info that can point back to you as an identified or identifiable person. Pretty straightforward, right?

- **Service**: When we mention "the Service," we're just talking about this Website.

- **Service Provider**: These are the folks (companies or individuals) who help us out by processing data for us. Think of them as third-party helpers we hire to keep the Service running, do stuff related to it, or help us figure out how you're using it.

- **Usage Data**: This is the info that gets automatically scooped up when you use the Service or from its own tech backbone. For example, how long you chill on a page. ⏰

- **Website**: That's **hubtoday**, our online home sweet home, found at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You**: This is, well, you! The person using or checking out our Service. Or, if you're doing it for a company or another legal entity, then "You" refers to that entity too.

## Getting Down to Business: Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### What Kind of Data Do We Collect?

#### Your Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" could totally include (but isn't limited to):

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets automatically collected the moment you start using the Service. Poof! ✨ It's there.

Usage Data might include goodies like your device's Internet Protocol address (aka IP address), your browser type and version, which pages you've been cruising on our Service, the exact time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other technical diagnostic data. 🕵️‍♂️

Heads up! 📱 If you're hitting up our Service via your mobile device, we might automatically snag some extra deets. This could include (but isn't just limited to!) the type of mobile device you're rockin', its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the specific mobile internet browser you're using, and yep, even more unique device identifiers and diagnostic data.

Whenever you visit our Service – desktop or mobile – we might also collect any info your browser decides to send our way. Just sayin'.

### Our Tracking Tech & What's Up with Cookies
We totally use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away some info. This tracking party includes goodies like beacons, tags, and scripts. They're all about collecting and tracking info to help us make our Service even better and analyze how it's doing. So, the tech we use might be:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies, if you're fancy)**: This is just a tiny file that gets popped onto your device. You can totally tell your browser to say 'nope!' to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But seriously, if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not play nice. 😬 Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to block Cookies, our Service will likely be using them, just so you know.
- **Web Beacons**: Alright, some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny, invisible electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). These little guys let us, for example, count how many awesome users have visited certain pages or opened an email. They also help with other cool website stats, like tracking how popular a section is or just making sure our systems and servers are all hunky-dory. ✅

So, Cookies come in two main flavors: 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Persistent Cookies are the ones that stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you've gone offline. Session Cookies, on the other hand, just poof! 💨 They're gone the moment you close your web browser.

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's the lowdown on why:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are the VIPs of Cookies! They're absolutely crucial for getting you the services available through the Website and making sure you can use all its cool features. They also help us verify who you are and stop any shady, fraudulent account usage. Without these bad boys, the services you're asking for just wouldn't happen. So yeah, we only use them to provide you with those services. 🔒
- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These simply remember if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website. No need to ask you twice! 😉
- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These are like our little helpers that remember choices you make when you're using the Website – stuff like your login details or what language you prefer. The whole point is to give you a super personalized experience and avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every single time you visit. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

Wanna dig deeper into the Cookies we use and what choices you have about them? No prob! Just swing by our Cookies Policy or hit up the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy. We've got all the deets there! 🍪

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use your Personal Data for a bunch of reasons, like these:

- To keep our Service up and running, and to make sure it's doing great. This includes keeping an eye on how it's being used. ⚙️
- To manage your Account: This means handling your registration as a user. The Personal Data you share helps you unlock all the cool features available to registered users. Sweet!
- To nail down any contracts: This covers developing, sticking to, and fulfilling purchase contracts for anything you buy, or any other agreement you make with us through the Service. Business stuff! 🤝
- To reach out to you: We might hit you up via email, phone calls, texts, or other digital ways (like push notifications from our app). This is for updates or important info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security alerts – especially when it's necessary or makes sense. 📞📧
- To keep you in the loop: We'll send you news, awesome special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering. This will be similar to what you've already bought or shown interest in, unless you tell us to chill out and not send you that info. 😉
- To manage your requests: This means we'll handle and deal with any requests you send our way. We got you! ✨
- For business transfers: If we're ever looking at a merger, selling off parts of the company, reorganizing, or any other kind of asset transfer (even if things go south like bankruptcy), we might use your info to make that happen. Your Personal Data, in such cases, would be one of the assets being transferred. Just keeping it real. 💼
- For other purposes: And hey, we might use your info for other stuff too, like doing some data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promo campaigns are actually working, and generally just making our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience even better. Always improving! 🚀

So, here's when we might share your personal info (just keeping you informed!):

- With Service Providers: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and might even get in touch with you. 📊
- For business transfers: During talks about mergers, selling company assets, financing, or if another company acquires us (partially or fully), we might share or transfer your personal info. It's just part of the deal. 💸
- With Affiliates: We might share your info with our affiliates. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Affiliates are basically our parent company, sister companies, joint venture buddies, or any other companies we control or share control with. 👯‍♀️
- With business partners: We could share your info with our business partners. Why? So they can hook you up with specific products, services, or some cool promotions. Win-win! 🤝
- With other users: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up in the public areas of our Service, just know that everyone can see it. And yeah, it might even get shared publicly outside the Service. So, be cool and think before you share! 📢
- With Your consent: If you give us the A-OK, we might totally spill your personal info for any other reason you agree to. It's all up to you! 😉

### Keeping Your Personal Data: How Long?
So, how long do we actually keep your Personal Data? 🤔 The Company only holds onto it for as long as we totally need it for the reasons we've mentioned in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your data as much as required to play by the legal rules (for example, if laws say we gotta keep it), to sort out any beefs, and to make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. Pretty standard stuff!

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for our own internal analysis. Usually, Usage Data doesn't stick around for ages. The exceptions? If we're using it to seriously amp up our Service's security, make it work even better, or if the law says we *have* to keep it longer. Otherwise, it's more of a short-term thing. ⏳

### Moving Your Personal Data Around
Alright, so your info (yep, Personal Data too!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in processing it are chilling. This means your info might get shipped off to – and stored on – computers outside your state, province, or country. Just a heads-up: the data protection laws in those other places might be totally different from where you are. So, something to keep in mind! 🌍

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and handing over your info, you're basically saying 'yep, I'm cool with that transfer.' Simple as that! ✅

The Company promises to take every reasonably necessary step to make sure your data is treated securely and totally aligns with this Privacy Policy. And nope, we won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're *super* sure they've got adequate controls in place – especially for the security of your data and other personal info. Your safety is our jam! 🛡️

### Wanna Delete Your Personal Data? You Got It!
Good news! You've totally got the right to delete your Personal Data, or ask us to help you delete any Personal Data we've collected about you. It's your info, after all! 💪

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right from inside the Service itself. Pretty handy, right?

You can totally update, tweak, or delete your info anytime! Just log into your Account (if you've got one) and head to the account settings section where you can manage all your personal details. Alternatively, feel free to hit us up directly and ask us to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us. We're here to help! 🙋‍♀️

Just a quick heads-up though: sometimes we might have to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so. Can't ditch everything, even if we wanted to! 😉

### When We Might Spill Your Personal Data (Disclosure)

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might totally get moved around. But don't sweat it – we'll definitely give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets transferred and ends up under a whole new Privacy Policy. We promise to keep you in the loop! 🔔

#### Law Enforcement
Okay, so under certain circumstances, the Company might have to totally spill your Personal Data. This happens if the law demands it or if public authorities (think courts or government agencies) make a valid request. It's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes when legal stuff is involved. 🚨

#### Other Legal Must-Dos
The Company might also dish out your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to do stuff like:

- Stick to our legal duties
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Prevent or investigate any possible screw-ups or wrongdoing connected to the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe and sound
- Dodge any legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe (We Try Our Best!)
The security of your Personal Data is a *huge* deal to us, no doubt about it! But let's keep it real: no method of sending stuff over the internet, or storing it electronically, is ever 100% bulletproof. While we bust our butts to use top-notch, commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't give you a *guarantee* of absolute security. It's the internet, after all! 🤷‍♀️

## Keeping the Kids' Privacy Secure 🧑‍🧒
Just so you know, our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We definitely don't knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your little one has given us Personal Data, please, *please* hit us up! If we ever discover we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without a parent's verified consent, we'll act fast to scrub that info from our servers. Kid safety first! 🚫👶

And if we need your consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country says parents need to sign off for kids, then yeah, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info. Gotta follow those rules! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## Links to Other Cool (or Not So Cool) Websites
Heads up! ⚠️ Our Service might have links to other websites that we totally don't operate. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Better safe than sorry, right?

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it crystal clear! 🚫

## Changes? Oh Yeah, to This Privacy Policy!
FYI, we might totally update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the fresh new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy! 👇

Before those changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. Plus, we'll make sure to update that 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. You won't miss it! 🔔

We totally suggest you periodically check out this Privacy Policy for any new changes. Just remember, any updates to this Privacy Policy become official the moment they're posted right here on this page. So keep an eye out! 👀

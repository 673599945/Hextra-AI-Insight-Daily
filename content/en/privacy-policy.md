*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy breaks down our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information when you use our Service. Plus, it fills you in on your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

We use your personal data to keep the Service running smoothly and make it even better. By using our Service, you're essentially saying "okay" to us collecting and using your info as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Explanations and Definitions

### Explanation
Ever notice some words are capitalized? 😉 Well, those fancy words have meanings specifically defined below. And yep, these definitions hold true whether they're singular or plural!

### Definitions
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** refers to a unique account we create for you, letting you jump into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate** means any entity that's got the reins, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity, or other voting securities that can elect directors or other management.

- **Company** (you'll see us called "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this policy) is none other than **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are those tiny files websites stash on your computer, phone, or any other device. They hold all sorts of info, like your browsing history on that site, and serve many purposes.

- **Country** means: California, USA! 🇺🇸

- **Device** means any gadget you use to hop onto our Service, like your computer, phone, or a digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is basically any info linked to someone who's already identified or can be identified.

- **Service**? That's our Website, plain and simple.

- **Service Provider** means any person or legal entity that crunches data on the Company's behalf. Think of them as third-party companies or individuals we hire to help us run, deliver, or analyze how our Service is being used. They're our support crew!

- **Usage Data** is the info we automatically collect. This data comes from you using the Service or from the Service's infrastructure itself (like how long you hung out on a page).

- **Website** means **hubtoday**, which you can easily find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You**? That's you! The individual checking out or using our Service. Or, if you're representing a company or other legal entity, then it means that entity.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
While you're enjoying our Service, we might casually ask you for some info that helps us get in touch or identify you. This "Personal Data" could include, but definitely isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's info we automatically grab as you're using the Service.

This Usage Data might include things like your device's Internet Protocol address (yep, that's your IP address!), what browser you're rocking, its version, which pages on our Service you popped into, when you visited, how long you hung out there, unique identifiers for your device, and other diagnostic tidbits.

Heads up! When you access the Service using your mobile device, we might automatically snag some info. This could be, but isn't limited to: the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the kind of mobile internet browser you're running, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We also might collect info that your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether that's on your computer or your mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're all about Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and store a bit of info. These tracking goodies include things like beacons, tags, and scripts. They help us gather and follow information, ultimately making our Service better and understanding how you use it. Our tech stack might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file that gets placed on your Device. You totally have the power to tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up whenever one's being sent. But, fair warning: if you don't accept Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service will likely be using them.

- **Web Beacons**: You might spot some small electronic files, dubbed web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs), chilling in certain parts of our Service and in our emails. These little guys let the Company, for example, count folks who've visited those pages or opened an email. They're also used for other cool website stats, like tracking how popular a section is or checking on system and server health.

So, Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies are the ones that hang around on your computer or mobile device even after you've logged off, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air the second you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We actually use both Session and Persistent Cookies for a bunch of reasons, which we'll break down for you right below:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    *   **Type**: Session Cookies
    *   **Administered by**: Us
    *   **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for us to deliver the services you find on the Website and to make sure you can actually use its awesome features. They're key players in verifying user identities and fighting off fraudulent use of user accounts. Seriously, without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't be possible, and we only deploy them to get those services to you.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    *   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    *   **Administered by**: Us
    *   **Purpose**: These Cookies simply help us remember if you've already given us the green light to use Cookies on the Website.

-   **Functional Cookies**
    *   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    *   **Administered by**: Us
    *   **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty cool because they help us remember all the choices you make while using the Website – think login info or your go-to language. Their main goal? To give you a super personalized experience, so you're not stuck re-entering your preferences every single time you swing by the Website.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
So, the Company might put your Personal Data to work for these reasons:

-   **To get our Service up and running and keep it tip-top**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
-   **To manage your Account**: We use it to handle your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over helps you unlock all those cool features only available to registered users.
-   **To fulfill our contracts**: This means setting up, sticking to, and completing the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service.
-   **To get in touch with you**: We might ping you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic methods (like push notifications from our mobile app) to keep you updated. This could be about new features, products, or services you've signed up for, including crucial security updates – basically, whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
-   **To keep you in the loop with news**: We love sharing special offers and general info about other cool goods, services, and events we're offering. These are usually similar to things you've already bought or shown interest in, unless, of course, you've told us you'd rather not get them.
-   **To handle your requests**: Yup, we'll process and manage any requests you throw our way.
-   **For business transfers**: Sometimes, we might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be part of a continuing business or during bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar procedures. In these cases, your Personal Data (which we hold about our Service users) could be one of the assets changing hands.
-   **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for other purposes like digging into data, spotting usage trends, figuring out how awesome our promo campaigns are, and generally evaluating and boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might end up sharing your personal information in these scenarios:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers to help them monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and yes, to get in touch with you.
-   **For business transfers**: During negotiations for, or in connection with, any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or the acquisition of all or part of our business by another company, we might share or transfer your personal information.
-   **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates. Don't worry, if we do, we'll make sure they promise to play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or that are under common control with us.
-   **With business partners**: Sometimes, we team up with business partners to bring you certain products, services, or promos. In those cases, we might share your info with them.
-   **With other users**: Just a heads-up: if you share personal information or interact in public areas with other users, that info might be seen by everyone and could even be publicly shared outside our Service. So, share wisely! 😉
-   **With your permission**: Last but not least, with your explicit consent, we might spill your personal information for any other purpose you agree to.

### Retaining Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as we *really* need it to achieve the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to meet our legal duties (say, if a law requires us to hang onto it), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are enforced.

The Company will also keep Usage Data around for internal analysis. Typically, Usage Data doesn't stick around too long, unless we're using it to beef up our Service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally required to keep it for a longer stretch.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Just so you know, your information (including your Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's main offices and wherever else the folks involved in the processing are located. This means your info could totally be transferred to and stored on computers outside your home state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Keep in mind, those places might have data protection laws that are different from yours!

By giving your "yes" to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're essentially signing off on that transfer.

The Company will do everything reasonably necessary to make sure your data is handled securely and follows this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're absolutely sure they have adequate controls in place, especially when it comes to the security of your data and other personal information. Safety first! 🔒

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You totally have the right to delete, or ask us for a little help deleting, any Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info directly from within the Service itself. Pretty handy, right?

You can totally update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one, of course!) and heading over to the account settings section where you can manage your personal information. You can also just hit us up directly to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up though: we might need to hang onto certain info if we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
So, sometimes, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) send us a valid request. We gotta play by the rules!

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also share your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Play nice with the law
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
- Stop or investigate any potential funny business related to the Service
- Keep Service users or the public safe and sound
- Guard against any legal headaches

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, truly! 🙏 But let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% foolproof. While we totally go all out using commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't give you a rock-solid guarantee of absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13 years old, period. We don't intentionally scoop up personally identifiable information from anyone below that age. If you're a parent or guardian and realize your kiddo has slipped us some Personal Data, please, please get in touch with us! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without proper parental consent, we'll act super fast to wipe that info from our servers.

If we ever need to rely on your consent as a legal reason to process your information, and your country requires parental consent, then you bet we might ask for your parent's "okay" before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. Just so you know, if you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit!

We simply have zero control over, and take absolutely no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Fair warning!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the updated Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes go live, we'll make sure to tell you via email and/or a big, noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated date" right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We recommend you pop back and check this Privacy Policy regularly for any updates. Changes to this Privacy Policy kick in the moment they're posted on this page.

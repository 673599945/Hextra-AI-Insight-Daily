## Scooping Up and Using Your Personal Data

### What Kind of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you use our Service, we might ask you to hand over certain personally identifiable info that helps us get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to:

-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets automatically scooped up when you're using the Service.

Usage Data might include stuff like your Device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you hit up on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you access the Service via a mobile Device, we might automatically collect certain info. This could include, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile Device you're using, its unique ID, your mobile Device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

Your browser sends us info, and we might collect that too, whether you're just visiting our Service or hitting it up from a mobile Device.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies üç™
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity within our Service and store certain info. The tracking tech we deploy includes beacons, tags, and scripts ‚Äì all designed to gather and track info, and ultimately to boost and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file plonked onto your Device. You can tell your browser to straight-up refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But heads up: if you don't play ball with Cookies, you might not be able to use some cool parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to deny Cookies, our Service will likely be using them.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some sections of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and are used for other related website stats (like tracking a section's popularity and double-checking system and server integrity).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies hang around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you've logged off, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for us to deliver the services available through the Website and to let you use some of its cool features. They're a big help in verifying users and stopping any shady, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just won't happen, and we only use them to get those services to you.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about figuring out if users have given the thumbs-up to using Cookies on the Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're cruising around the Website, like keeping your login info or language preferences in mind. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, saving you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you hit up the Website.

For more deets on the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, hop over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### Holding onto Your Personal Data üï∞Ô∏è
The Company will only hang onto Your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to play by our legal obligations (like if we have to hold onto your data to follow applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data typically sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or boost its functionality, or if we're legally obliged to hold onto that data for longer.

### Moving Your Personal Data Around
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get transferred to ‚Äì and kept on ‚Äì computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws could be different from your neck of the woods.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving the green light to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure Your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer Your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place (including security for Your data and other personal info).

### Wiping Out Your Personal Data üóëÔ∏è
You've got the right to delete or ask for our help in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about you right from within the Service itself.

You can always update, modify, or delete your info by logging into your Account (if you've got one) and hitting up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also give us a shout to request access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've handed over to us.

But keep in mind, we might need to hold onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Spilling the Beans on Your Personal Data ü§´

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, Your Personal Data might get moved. We'll give you a heads-up before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement Stuff
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill Your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Must-Dos
The Company might spill Your Personal Data, genuinely believing such action is necessary to:
-   Play by legal obligations
-   Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
-   Stay clear of legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe üîí
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us! But remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect Your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kiddo Privacy üë∂
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13 years old. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your info, and Your country requires parental consent, we might ask for Your parents' go-ahead before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Hangouts üåê
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click a third-party link, you'll get redirected to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every website you cruise.

We can't control the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services, and we don't take on any responsibility for them.

## Tweaks to This Privacy Policy üõ†Ô∏è
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a heads-up about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll retain and use your Personal Data to the extent required to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we need to keep your data to abide by applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless this data is used to beef up the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or we're legally obliged to retain this data for longer periods.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws could differ from those in your jurisdiction.

By consenting to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're agreeing to this transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure your data is treated securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will occur to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

However, please note that we may need to retain certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might be transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Under certain circumstances, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

The Company may disclose your Personal Data in good faith, believing that such action is necessary to:

-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're aware that your kiddo has provided us with Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verification of parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we may ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might include links to other websites that aren't operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over — and assume no responsibility for — the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Bummer, we know! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll clue you in on any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes become effective, we'll notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We recommend you give this Privacy Policy a regular once-over for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.

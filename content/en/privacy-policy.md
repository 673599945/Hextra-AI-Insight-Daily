# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy is all about how we handle your info. It details our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and spilling the beans on your data when you use our Service. Plus, it'll clue you in on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We use your personal data to power and polish our Service. By hopping onto the Service, you're essentially giving us the green light to collect and use your info according to this Privacy Policy. Easy peasy, right?

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation

Words we've capitalized have specific meanings, which we'll spell out below. And hey, whether they're singular or plural, these definitions stay the same. No tricks here!

### Definitions

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

-   **Account** means a unique account we cook up for you to hop into our Service or certain parts of it.

-   **Affiliate** means an entity that's either calling the shots, being called the shots by, or sharing the shots with another party. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity, or other voting goodies that get to pick directors or other big wigs.

-   **Company** (yep, that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this whole agreement) refers to **hubtoday**.

-   **Cookies** are those tiny files websites stash on your computer, phone, or whatever device you're using. They're packed with details like your browsing history on that site, and they do a bunch of other stuff too.

-   **Country** means: California, USA. üá∫üá∏

-   **Device** means anything you can use to tap into our Service, like your computer, phone, or even a digital tablet.

-   **Personal Data** is any info that hooks up to someone who's identified or identifiable. Think of it as data with a face (or a potential face!).

-   **Service** means, you guessed it, our Website.

-   **Service Provider** means any person or company that crunches data for the Company. We're talking about those third-party folks or businesses we hire to help run the Service, deliver it for us, handle Service-related tasks, or even help us figure out how people are actually using it.

-   **Usage Data** refers to the data that's automatically scooped up. This info is either generated just by you using the Service or from the Service's own infrastructure (like, how long you hung out on a certain page).

-   **Website** refers to **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`

-   **You** means, well, you! The individual using or checking out our Service. Or, if you're rocking it on behalf of a company or other legal entity, then that's "You" too.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data

When you're hanging out on our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This 'personally identifiable information' could include, but isn't just limited to:

-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data

Usage Data? That stuff gets automatically scooped up whenever you're using the Service.

Usage Data can include things like your device's IP address (that's its Internet Protocol address, just so you know üòâ), your browser type and version, which pages of our Service you check out, when you visited and for how long, unique identifiers for your device, and other techy diagnostic info.

Hitting up the Service on your phone or tablet? We might automatically grab some info, like the type of mobile device you're using, its special ID, your mobile IP address, your phone's operating system, the mobile browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic bits. It's all about making sure things run smoothly!

We might also snag some info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether you're on a desktop or going mobile.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies

We're big fans of Cookies and other tracking tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and store some info. Think of it as using beacons, tags, and scripts to gather data, track stuff, and generally make our Service better and sharper. Here's a peek at what we use:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file that lands on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's trying to come through. But heads up: if you block Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, chances are our Service will be using them.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). They help us, for example, count how many users have checked out certain pages or opened an email. They're also handy for other website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or double-checking that our systems are running smoothly.

So, Cookies can be either 'Persistent' or 'Session' types. Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or phone even after you've logged off, but Session Cookies? Poof! They vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's why:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for making sure you can actually use the services available on our Website and tap into all its cool features. They're like bouncers, helping us confirm who you are and stopping any sneaky, fraudulent use of accounts. Seriously, without these, we can't give you the services you asked for, and that's the *only* reason we use them.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies simply let us know if you've given us the thumbs up on using cookies on our Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty neat because they help us remember your choices when you're cruising around the Website, like your login info or what language you prefer. Basically, they're here to give you a smoother, more personalized experience so you don't have to keep punching in your preferences every single time. Smart, right? üß†

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and your options? Just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data

The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:

-   **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on how it's being used.
-   **To manage Your Account**: We use it to handle your registration as a Service user. That Personal Data you share? It's what lets you unlock all the cool features available to registered users.
-   **For the performance of a contract**: This means handling the nitty-gritty of purchase contracts for stuff you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service. We're talking development, compliance, and fulfilling those commitments!
-   **To contact You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other digital chats (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is usually about updates or important info related to features, products, or services you've signed up for ‚Äì including security updates! We only do this when it's necessary or makes sense.
-   **To provide You with news**, sweet special offers, and general info about other awesome stuff, services, and events we're offering. This is usually similar to what you've already bought or shown interest in, unless you've told us to pump the brakes on these kinds of updates.
-   **To manage Your requests**: This is all about handling and sorting out any requests you send our way. We got you! üëç
-   **For business transfers**: If things get wild and we're looking at a merger, selling off parts of the business, or some other major corporate shake-up (like bankruptcy or liquidation), we might use your info to help evaluate or pull off that deal. In such cases, your Personal Data about our Service users could be one of the assets changing hands.
-   **For other purposes**: Yep, we might also use your info for other cool stuff, like deep-diving into data analytics, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually hitting the mark, and generally sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. It's all about making things better! ‚ú®

So, when might we actually share your personal info? Here are the scenarios:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might hand over your personal info to our Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on Service usage and might even get in touch with you on our behalf.
-   **For business transfers**: If we're ever in talks for a merger, selling off company assets, getting financing, or another company is looking to buy us out (partially or fully), we might share or transfer your personal info during those discussions or the actual deal.
-   **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates. When we do, we'll make sure they promise to play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates? Think our parent company, sister companies, joint venture buddies, or any other companies under our wing or sharing the same control.
-   **With business partners**: We could share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or even some cool promotions. Who doesn't love a good deal? üòâ
-   **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up in public areas with other users, just know that info could be seen by everyone and even broadcast publicly outside the Service. So, share wisely! ü§´
-   **With Your consent**: And hey, if you give us the nod, we might spill your personal info for any other reason you agree to. Your call! ü§ù

### Retention of Your Personal Data

The Company? We'll only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as we absolutely need it for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your data to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we have to), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. Pretty standard stuff, right?

The Company also holds onto Usage Data for our own internal analysis. This kind of data usually doesn't stick around for long, *unless* it's helping us beef up security or boost the Service's features, or if we're legally required to keep it for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your info (yeah, that includes your Personal Data!) gets processed at our Company's main offices and wherever the folks involved in the processing are hanging out. This basically means your data might zip across borders and land on computers outside your state, province, or country. Data protection laws can be a bit different in those places compared to where you are, just so you know! üåç

By giving a 'yes' to this Privacy Policy and then handing over your info, you're essentially saying 'okay' to that transfer. Got it? üëç

The Company is committed to taking every reasonable step to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We're not going to ship your Personal Data off to just any organization or country unless we're darn sure there are solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. Your safety is our priority! üîí

### Deleting Your Personal Data

Good news! You've got the power to delete your Personal Data that we've collected, or you can just ask us to lend a hand in getting rid of it for you. Your data, your rules!

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right there from inside the platform. Pretty convenient, huh?

You can totally update, tweak, or zap your info anytime! Just log into your Account (if you've got one) and head over to the account settings where you can manage your personal data. Or, if you prefer, just ping us, and we can help you access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a quick heads-up though: we might need to hang onto some info if we have a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so. Some things just have to stay!

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions

If the Company ever gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or selling off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred too. Don't worry, we'll give you a heads-up before your data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key! üîë

#### Law enforcement

Sometimes, if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) send us a valid request, the Company might have to cough up your Personal Data. It's not our first choice, but sometimes we have to comply! üöî

#### Other Legal Requirements

The Company might also decide to disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's absolutely necessary to:

-   Comply with a legal obligation
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data

Look, keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us. BUT, let's be real: no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% hack-proof. While we bust our butts to use top-tier, commercially acceptable ways to protect your data, we just can't give a rock-solid guarantee of absolute security. It's the internet, folks! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Children's Privacy

Just so we're clear: our Service isn't for anyone under 13. We absolutely do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable info from kids under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your little one has somehow slipped us their Personal Data, please, please reach out! If we ever realize we've accidentally collected data from someone under 13 without a parent's OK, we'll act fast to scrub that info from our servers. Kids' privacy is serious business! üë∂üõë

Also, if we need to get your 'okay' as a legal green light to process your info, and your country actually requires a parent's consent, then we might just ask your folks for their permission before we gather and use that data. Better safe than sorry! üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service might have links that take you to other websites ‚Äì ones we don't actually run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We seriously recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of every single website you visit. Stay savvy! üëÄ

Just a heads up: we don't have any say over, and we don't take any responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of *any* third-party sites or services out there. They're on their own!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We might give our Privacy Policy a facelift now and then. If we make any changes, we'll let you know by simply posting the updated Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes go live, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. Plus, we'll update that 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. You'll always be in the loop! üîî

We recommend you check out this Privacy Policy regularly to catch any changes. Just remember, once a change is posted on this page, it's officially in effect. No going back!

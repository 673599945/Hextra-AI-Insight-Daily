We totally use your personal data to power and level up our Service. When you hop on board and use the Service, you're giving us the green light to collect and use your info, all according to this Privacy Policy. Easy peasy!

## Explanations & Definitions

### Explanations
Okay, so any words you see capitalized? They've got meanings specific to the conditions laid out below. Doesn't matter if they're singular or plural, these definitions stay the same. Got it?

### Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means your unique login created so you can get into our Service, or at least bits of it.
- **Affiliate** is basically any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. When we say "control," we're talking about owning 50% or more of the shares, equity, or other securities that let you vote for directors or other big wigs.
- **Company** (you'll see us called "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this agreement) means **Hexi 2077's AI Daily**.

- **Service**? That's our Website, plain and simple.
- **Service Provider** is basically anyone or any company that crunches data for us. We're talking about third-party companies or individuals we bring on board to help us run the Service, deliver it to you, handle related stuff, or even help us figure out how you're using it. They're our trusty sidekicks! üí™
- **Usage Data** is the info we collect automatically, just by you using the Service or from the Service's tech bits. Think of it as the Service telling us how long you hung out on a page, for example. Pretty automated, right?
- **Website** means **Hexi 2077's AI Daily**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`. üåê
- **You**? That's you, the awesome individual using our Service! Or, if you're rocking it on behalf of a company or other legal crew, then that's you too. Basically, anyone using the Service. üòé

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're diving into our Service, we might ask for a few bits of personal info that can help us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal identifiable info could be things like (but totally not limited to):

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's the stuff we automatically collect just by you using our Service. No biggie!

Your Usage Data might include cool things like your device's IP address (yep, that's your Internet Protocol address!), what browser you're using and its version, which pages of our Service you hit up, the exact time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique identifiers for your device, and other diagnostic goodies.

Hopping onto our Service from a mobile device? We might automatically snag some info like what type of phone you're using, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the kind of mobile browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic bits. Just so you know!

Oh, and we might also grab info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether that's on a computer or from your mobile device. Just keeping tabs, in a good way! üòâ

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We use Cookies and other similar tracking tech to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and store some bits of info. These sneaky tracking tools include things like beacons, tags, and scripts ‚Äì they help us gather and follow data, making our Service better and helping us understand how it's being used. Here‚Äôs what we might use:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file that gets stashed on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, heads up! If you don't accept Cookies, you might miss out on some cool parts of our Service. Unless you've specifically told your browser to ditch Cookies, our Service will likely use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have tiny electronic files called web beacons (think clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). These little guys let the Company, for instance, count who's visited those pages or opened an email. They're also used for other website stats, like checking how popular a section is or making sure our systems and servers are all good to go.

So, Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. The Persistent ones stick around on your computer or phone even after you're offline. But Session Cookies? Poof! They're gone the second you close your web browser. Pretty straightforward, right?

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the reasons listed below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super crucial for us to even give you the services on the Website and let you use some of its cool features. They're like our security guards, helping verify who you are and stopping any sneaky, fraudulent use of accounts. Seriously, without 'em, the services you want just wouldn't work, so we only use them to make sure you get what you came for.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty straightforward ‚Äì they just let us know if you've already given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website. Simple as that! üëç

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are all about making your experience smoother! They help us remember your choices when you're cruising around the Website, like your login deets or your favorite language. The whole point is to give you a super personalized experience, so you don't have to keep typing in your preferences every single time. Handy, right?

Wanna dig deeper into the Cookies we use and your choices about 'em? Just hop over to our Cookies Policy or hit up the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy. All the deets are there! üëá

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for these cool reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**: This includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used, so it's always tip-top!
- **To manage your Account**: We use your data to handle your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you unlock all the cool features available to you as a registered user. Sweet!
- **For contract performance**: This is all about making sure we fulfill those contracts for stuff you've bought, like products, items, or services, or any other agreement you've got with us through the Service. We gotta deliver on our promises! ü§ù
- **To get in touch with you**: We might ping you via email, phone calls, texts, or other electronic cool ways (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is usually for updates or info about features, products, or services you've signed up for ‚Äì including those super important security updates ‚Äì when it makes sense to do so.
- **To keep you in the loop**: We love sharing news, special offers, and general info about other awesome stuff, services, and events we've got going on. If it's similar to what you've already bought or asked about, we'll send it your way ‚Äì unless you've told us to chill out and not send that kind of info. Your call! üòâ
- **To handle your requests**: We're here to process and manage any requests you throw our way. We've got you covered!
- **For business big moves**: We might use your info if we're looking at or going through a merger, selling off parts of the company, restructuring, reorganizing, dissolving, or basically any other sale or transfer of our assets ‚Äì whether we're still operating or in a bankruptcy/liquidation situation. Your Personal Data, as a Service user, could be part of those assets changing hands. It's all part of the business game!
- **For other cool stuff**: We might also use your info for other purposes, like diving deep into data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are hitting the mark, and generally boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always aiming to be better! ‚ú®

We might share your personal info in these situations:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our trusty Service Providers. They help us keep an eye on how our Service is being used and can even get in touch with you. Teamwork makes the dream work! ü§ù
- **For business big moves**: Just like before, we might share or transfer your personal info if we're involved in any mergers, selling company assets, financing rounds, or if another company is taking over all or part of our biz. It's all part of the negotiation dance.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliated companies. If we do, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates are basically our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or other companies that are under our control or controlled along with us. Family matters! üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
- **With Business Partners**: We might team up with business partners and share your info to bring you some cool products, services, or special promotions. Win-win!
- **With Other Users**: Heads up! When you share personal info or chat it up in public areas with other users, that info can be seen by everyone and might even get shared publicly outside the Service. So, be mindful of what you post! üì¢
- **With your blessing**: We might spill your personal info for any other reason, but only if you give us your explicit "okay." Your choice, always!

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data hanging around for as long as it's needed for the purposes spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your data only as much as we have to for legal stuff (like when the law says 'keep this!'), sorting out any disagreements, and making sure our legal agreements and policies are followed. Fair's fair!

The Company also keeps Usage Data for our own internal analysis ‚Äì just to make things better! Usually, Usage Data doesn't stick around for long, unless it's for beefing up our Service's security, making it even more awesome, or if we're legally obliged to hold onto it for a bit longer. We're talking security first! üõ°Ô∏è

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
So, your info (yep, including your Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's main hubs and wherever else our partners are doing their thing. This means your info might get jetted off to and stored on computers outside your state, province, or even country. Just a heads-up: the data protection laws there might be different from where you are. Wild, right?

By giving us the 'okay' on this Privacy Policy and then handing over your info, you're basically saying 'yes' to that transfer. Got it?

The Company is gonna take all the reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled super securely and stays in line with this Privacy Policy. We're not gonna send your Personal Data flying off to some random organization or country unless we're absolutely sure there are solid security measures in place ‚Äì that means protecting your data and all other personal info. Safety first, always! üîê

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the power! You can totally delete, or ask us to help delete, any Personal Data we've collected about you. Your data, your rules! ‚ú®

Good news! Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right from inside the Service itself. How convenient is that?

You can totally update, tweak, or zap your info anytime by logging into your Account (if you've got one, of course!) and heading to the account settings where you can manage your personal deets. Or, hey, just shoot us a message if you wanna access, fix, or delete any personal info you've given us. We're here to help!

Just a little heads-up though: sometimes we might have to keep some info if we're legally obliged to, or if we have a valid reason to. Can't always get rid of everything, sorry! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Big news! If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. But don't sweat it ‚Äì we'll give you a heads-up before your data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Transparency is key!

#### Law Enforcement
In some situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or a government agency) come knocking with a valid request. We gotta follow the rules!

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might reveal your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Play by the legal rules.
- Protect and defend the Company's rights or property ‚Äì gotta guard our turf!
- Prevent or investigate any shady business related to the Service.
- Keep Service users and the public safe and sound.
- Guard against any legal headaches.

### Security of Your Personal Data
Okay, so the security of your Personal Data is a *huge* deal to us! But, real talk: no method of sending data over the internet or storing it electronically is 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts using top-notch, commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it's *absolutely* secure. Just keeping it real! üòÖ

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under 13, plain and simple. We absolutely do not knowingly collect personal info from kids under that age. Parents and guardians, listen up! If you know your little one has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us pronto. If we ever discover we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without proper parental consent, we'll quickly move to delete that info from our servers. Kid safety first! üíñ

If we ever need your 'okay' (consent!) to process your info, and your country says a parent has to give that 'okay' for kids, then we might ask for your parent's permission *before* we collect and use that info. Just making sure we're all compliant!

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on one of those third-party links, bam! You'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of *every single site* you visit. Better safe than sorry! üßê

Just so we're clear: We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services out there. They're on their own!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time ‚Äì hey, things change! When we do, we'll let you know by slapping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. Easy peasy!

Before those changes go live, we'll make sure you get a heads-up via email and/or a super noticeable alert on our Service. We'll also update that 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises here! üóìÔ∏è

We totally recommend you check this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Just remember, any changes to this Privacy Policy go into effect the moment they're posted right here on this page. So, keep an eye out! üëÄ

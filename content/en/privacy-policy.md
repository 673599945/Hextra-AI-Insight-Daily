# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy explains our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your info when you use the Service. It also spills the beans on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We use your personal data to power and jazz up the Service. By using the Service, you're essentially giving us a nod to collect and use your info according to this Privacy Policy.

## Let's Talk Definitions (and What They Mean)

### Getting It Clear
Capitalized words have meanings defined under these specific conditions. These definitions hold true whether they pop up in singular or plural form.

### The Nitty-Gritty Definitions
For the sake of this Privacy Policy, here's what we mean:

-   **Account** means a unique account whipped up just for you to get a grip on our Service or parts of it.

-   **Affiliate** refers to an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. Here, "control" means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that carry voting rights for the election of directors or other managing bigwigs.

-   **Company** (referred to as either "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) means **hubtoday**.

-   **Country** means: California, USA.

-   **Device** means any gadget that can tap into the Service, like a computer, cell phone, or a snazzy digital tablet.

-   **Personal Data** is any info connected to an identified or identifiable individual.

-   **Service** refers to the Website.

-   **Usage Data** is automatically collected info, generated by using the Service or the Service infrastructure itself (think: how long you chill on a page).

-   **Website** refers to **hubtoday**, which you can hit up at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

-   **You** means the individual checking out or using the Service, or the company or other legal entity that individual is representing when they access or use the Service.

## Grabbing and Using Your Personal Data

### What Kind of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you to share some personally identifiable information that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to:

-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets automatically collected when you're using the Service.

Usage Data can spill the beans on your device's Internet Protocol address (like an IP address), browser type, browser version, which pages of our Service you visited, the time and date of your visit, how much time you spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're tapping into the Service on a mobile device, we might automatically grab certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to: the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also collect info that your browser sends our way when you visit our Service or access it through a mobile device.

### Tracking Tech and Cookies: The Lowdown
We use Cookies and similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away certain info. The tracking tech we use includes beacons, tags, and scripts, all designed to gather and track info, plus improve and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file plopped onto your Device. You can tell your browser to kick all Cookies to the curb or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't play ball with Cookies, you might not be able to use some parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to say "no thanks" to Cookies, our Service just might use 'em.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These bad boys let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like checking out a section's popularity and making sure the system and servers are all good).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies hang around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you're offline, while Session Cookies get wiped the moment you slam shut your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the following reasons:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They're all about authenticating users and putting a stop to shady use of user accounts. Without these bad boys, the services you ask for simply can't be delivered, and we only use 'em to give you those services.

-   **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Notification Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are here to figure out if users have given a thumbs-up to the use of Cookies on the Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're cruising around the Website, like keeping your login deets or language preferences in mind. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of typing in your preferences every single time you visit.

For more info on the Cookies we use and your options regarding 'em, zip over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use personal data for the following cool reasons:

-   **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
-   **To manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The personal data you share lets you tap into different features available to you as a registered user.
-   **For the performance of a contract**: This involves putting together, sticking to, and fulfilling the purchase contract for products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract you've got going with us through the Service.
-   **To contact You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other equivalent electronic comms (like push notifications from a mobile app). This is to give you updates or informational messages related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, whenever they're necessary or make sense.
-   **To provide You with news**, sweet special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we dish out. These might be similar to stuff you've already snagged or enquired about, unless you've opted out of getting such info.
-   **To manage Your requests**: This means handling and overseeing the requests you shoot our way.
-   **For business transfers**: We might use your info to suss out or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, where personal data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets getting transferred.
-   **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other stuff like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and generally sprucing up our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

We might share your personal info in these situations:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with Service Providers to keep an eye on and analyze how our Service is being used, and to get in touch with you.
-   **For business transfers**: We might share or transfer your personal info during any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a chunk of our business by another company, either during negotiations or the actual process.
-   **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates, and in that scenario, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or are under common control with us.
-   **With business partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or promo deals.
-   **With other users**: When you swap personal info or interact in public areas with other users, that info might be seen by everyone and could even get publicly broadcasted outside.
-   **With Your consent**: If you give us the green light, we might spill your personal info for any other reason.

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your personal data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes spilled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your personal data to the extent required to play by our legal obligations (like if we gotta keep your data to obey applicable laws), hash out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is being used to beef up the security of our Service or jazz up its functionality, or if we're legally on the hook to keep that data for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and anywhere else where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get shuffled to and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other government jurisdiction, where data protection laws might be different from your jurisdiction's laws.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and hitting submit on that info, you're essentially giving a big "yes" to that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and plays nice with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place (including security for your data and other personal info).

### Poof! Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to give you a hand in deleting the personal data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've tossed our way.

But keep in mind, sometimes we might need to hang onto certain info if we've got a legal obligation or a legit reason to.

### When We Spill Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data might get moved around. We'll give you a heads-up before your personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement Fun
In certain situations, the Company might be asked to spill your personal data if the law says so or if there's a legit request from public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Stuff
The Company might spill your personal data if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
-   Play by legal obligations
-   Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected to the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the general public
-   Steer clear of legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe and Sound
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## The Kiddos and Their Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under the age of 13. We're not intentionally collecting personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has handed over Personal Data to us, hit us up! If we discover we've snagged Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal lowdown for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parent's green light before collecting and using that info.

## Links to Other Websites: The Road Ahead
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we're not taking any responsibility for 'em.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you the heads-up about any changes by dropping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before changes hit the fan, we'll let you know via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service, and we'll update that "Last updated date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We totally advise you to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy are live the moment they're posted on this page.

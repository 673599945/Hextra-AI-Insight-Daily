## Collecting & Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might ask you for some personally identifiable information that helps us get in touch or identify you. This could include, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's collected automatically when you use the Service.

Your device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you hit on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data might all be part of Usage Data.

When you're accessing the Service with a mobile device, we might automatically grab certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

Your browser might also send us info when you visit our Service or access it through a mobile device â€“ and we might collect that too!

### Tracking Technologies & Cookies
We use Cookies and other similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash certain info. This tech includes beacons, tags, and scripts, all aimed at collecting and tracking info, plus sprucing up and analyzing our Service. Hereâ€™s what we might be using:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is just a tiny file chilling on your device. You can totally tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't play nice with Cookies, some parts of our Service might be off-limits. Unless youâ€™ve tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the boot, our Service will likely be using them.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs). These bad boys let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and help with other website stats (like checking out how popular a section is and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies can be either 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Persistent Cookies hang around on your personal computer or mobile device even after you go offline, but Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super important for dishing out the services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help verify who's who and prevent any dodgy use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply wouldn't work, and we only use them to make sure you get those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies help us figure out if users have given a thumbs-up to Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember your choices when youâ€™re using the Website, like keeping your login info or language preferences handy. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you visit.

For even more info on the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, hop over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (like if we have to keep your data to follow applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data typically sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to boost the security or improve the functionality of our Service, or we're legally bound to hold onto it for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might be zipped over to â€“ and kept on â€“ computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where data protection laws could be different from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and handing over such info, you're essentially signing off on that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and according to this Privacy Policy. No transfer of your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You have the right to delete or ask us to help delete the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service.

You can update, modify, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you have one) and heading to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Data you've given us.

But keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. Weâ€™ll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might cough up your Personal Data, believing in good faith that such action is necessary to:
- Fulfill a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but letâ€™s be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. Fingers crossed! ðŸ¤ž

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If youâ€™re a parent or guardian and you know your child has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out that weâ€™ve collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parentâ€™s consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just a heads-up! ðŸš©

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes take effect, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the 'Last Updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy. Stay tuned! ðŸš€

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.

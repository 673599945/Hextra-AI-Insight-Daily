### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% foolproof.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we scoop up and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over, and assume zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right on this page.

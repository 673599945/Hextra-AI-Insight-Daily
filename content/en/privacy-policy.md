### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe
Keeping your Personal Data safe is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Kiddo Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13. We don't knowingly collect personal identification info from anyone younger than 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kid has handed over Personal Data to us, hit us up. If we figure out we’ve scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll totally boot that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parents' thumbs-up before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get zapped to that third-party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we're not taking any responsibility for 'em.

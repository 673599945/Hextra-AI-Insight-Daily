# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! This Privacy Policy is all about how we collect, use, and share your info when you're rocking our Service. We'll also spill the deets on your privacy rights and how the law protects 'em.

We use your personal data to power up and level up our Service. By using the Service, you're essentially giving us a high-five to collect and use your info according to this Privacy Policy. 😉

## Explanations & Definitions

### Explanations
Capitalized words? They've got meanings defined under these conditions. Whether they're chilling in singular or plural form, these definitions rock the same meaning.

### Definitions
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means a unique account crafted just for you to get access to our Service or parts of our Service.

- **Affiliate** means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. Here, "control" is all about owning 50% or more of the shares, equity interest, or other securities that get you voting rights for directors or other managing authorities. 😎

- **Company** (we might call us "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to **hubtoday**. That's us! 🚀

- **Cookies** are tiny files that a website drops onto your computer, mobile device, or any other gadget. They're packed with details about your browsing history on that site, plus a bunch of other uses.

- **Country** refers to: The State of California, USA. 🇺🇸

- **Device** means any gadget that can tap into the Service, like a computer, cell phone, or a digital tablet. 📱

- **Personal Data** is any info that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. Easy peasy.

- **Service** refers to this Website. Duh! 😉

- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who processes data on behalf of the Company. Think of 'em as third-party companies or folks hired by the Company to help deliver the Service, provide the Service for the Company, perform Service-related tasks, or help us analyze how the Service is being used. They're our trusty sidekicks! 💪

- **Usage Data** refers to data that's automatically collected, generated either by using the Service or by the Service infrastructure itself (like, for example, how long you hung out on a page).

- **Website** refers to **hubtoday**, which you can check out at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means the individual who's accessing or using the Service, or the company or other legal entity on behalf of whom such individual is accessing or using the Service. That's *you*! 👇

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might hit you up for certain personally identifiable info that helps us get in touch with you or figure out who you are. This personal info could include, but isn't limited to: 📝

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? It's automatically collected when you're using the Service.

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like, your IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you visited on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how long you hung out on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Phew, that's a mouthful! 📊

When you're tapping into the Service from your mobile device, we might automatically scoop up some info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also snag info your browser sends when you visit our Service or access it via a mobile device. Just a heads-up! 🤓

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're all about using Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash some info. The tracking tech we use includes beacons, tags, and scripts, which help us collect and track info, plus improve and analyze our Service. The tech we might use includes: 🍪

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file that gets placed on your device. You can tell your browser to reject all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But hey, if you don't accept Cookies, you might not be able to use some cool parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service might just use 'em.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like, noting the popularity of a certain section and checking system and server integrity). Sneaky, right? 😉

Cookies can be "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We rock both Session and Persistent Cookies for these purposes: 👇

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are super crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to deliver those services to you. Gotta have 'em! 👍

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to figure out if users have given a thumbs-up to the use of Cookies on the Website. So we know you're cool with it! ✅

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you use the Website, like recalling your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you visit. Smart, right? 🧠

For the full scoop on the Cookies we use and your options regarding Cookies, head over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy. You're in control! ⚙️

The Company might use Personal Data for these purposes: 👇

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used. We gotta keep things running smoothly! 🛠️
- **To manage your Account**: This involves handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you provide lets you tap into different features available to you as a registered user. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

- **To contact you**: We'll reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other equivalent electronic communication forms (like mobile app push notifications) to give you updates or informational comms related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, when it's necessary or makes sense. We'll keep you in the loop! 📧📱
- **To provide you with news**, special offers, and general info about other awesome goods, services, and events we're offering. Think of stuff similar to what you've already snagged or asked about, unless you've told us to pump the brakes on these kinds of messages. Your call! 📰✨
- **To manage your requests**: This involves handling and taking care of the requests you make to us. We're here to help! 🙋‍♀️
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar shenanigans, where Personal Data we hold about our Service users is one of the assets getting transferred. Just letting you know! 💼
- **For other purposes**: We might use your info for other cool stuff like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and evaluating and improving our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Always striving for better! ⭐

We might share your personal info in these situations: 👇

Affiliates include our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies we control or are under common control with. It's a family affair! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- **With business partners**: We might share your info with our business partners to hook you up with certain products, services, or promotions. Teamwork makes the dream work! 👯‍♀️

- **With your consent**: We might spill your personal info for any other purpose if you give us the go-ahead. You're the boss! 👑

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to follow our legal obligations (like, if we need to keep your data to comply with applicable laws), sort out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies. We're playing by the rules! ⚖️

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter time, unless it's being used to beef up our Service's security or improve its features, or if we're legally obliged to hang onto that data for longer. Good to know, right? 🤔

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) is processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in processing are located. This means your info might get transferred to and stored on computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the data protection laws might differ from your jurisdiction's laws. It's a global thing! 🌍

Your consent to this Privacy Policy and your submission of such info mean you're cool with that transfer. Just giving you the heads-up! ✅

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of your data and other personal info. We're serious about security! 🔒

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete your Personal Data we've collected about you, or ask us to help you delete it. Your data, your rules! 💅

Our Service might give you the power to delete certain info about yourself right from within the Service. Pretty handy, right? ✨

You can always update, modify, or delete your info by logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading over to the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also hit us up to request access to, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us. We're here for ya! 🙋‍♂️

But keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. Just a heads-up! 🚨

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. Don't worry, we'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. Forewarned is forearmed! 🔔

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency). We gotta play by their rules! 👮‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might disclose your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to: 👇

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us! 🔐 But hey, let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. We're trying our best! 🤞

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't for anyone under the age of 13. Nope, not for kids! We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers. Kids, stick to your games! 🧒👧

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info. Just making sure everyone's on board! 👨‍👩‍👧

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We totally recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay safe out there! 🌐

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just a heads-up! 🤷‍♀️

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy every now and then. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page. So keep an eye out! 👀

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated date" at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises here! 🗓️

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page. Stay informed! 🧠

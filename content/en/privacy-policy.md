### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
The Company will only hang onto your Personal Data for as long as it's totally necessary for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also stash and use your Personal Data to the extent needed to play by our legal obligations (like, if we gotta hold onto your data to follow applicable laws), settle disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also keep Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or give its functionality a facelift, or if we're legally on the hook to keep that data for a longer stretch.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your info (that includes Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are chillin'. This means that this info might get shipped off to and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction, where the data protection laws might be a bit different from your jurisdiction's laws.

Your 'okay' to this Privacy Policy and your submission of such info means you're totally cool with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonable steps needed to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't be shipping your Personal Data off to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place (including the security of your data and other personal information).

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You totally have the right to delete or ask us to lend a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself.

You can always log into your Account (if you've got one!) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info to update, tweak, or delete your info. Or, you can just reach out to us to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any Personal Data you've thrown our way.

But heads up: we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a legit basis to do so.

### Disclosing Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get shipped off. We'll totally give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets transferred and falls under a different privacy policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain situations, the Company might get nudged to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or in response to a valid request from public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data in good faith, believing such action is necessary to:

-   Play by legal obligations
-   Protect and defend the Company's rights or property
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected to the Service
-   Keep Service users or the public safe and sound
-   Dodge legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Secure
Keeping your Personal Data safe and sound is a big deal to us. But hey, remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% bulletproof. While we totally bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't give you a rock-solid guarantee of its absolute security.

## Kiddo Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't intentionally scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're clued in that your kiddo has handed over Personal Data to us, please hit us up. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll totally take steps to delete that info from our servers. Pinky swear!

If we gotta lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might just ask for your parents' 'okay' before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Cool Sites
Our Service might have links to other websites that we don't totally run. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get zoomed over to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we're not taking any responsibility for 'em.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might give our Privacy Policy a facelift from time to time. We'll totally let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update that "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peep this Privacy Policy regularly for any tweaks. Changes to this Privacy Policy are good to go when they're posted on this page.

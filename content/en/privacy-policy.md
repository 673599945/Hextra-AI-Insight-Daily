## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets automatically scooped up when you're using the Service.

Usage Data can include your device's Internet Protocol address (like an IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages you visited on our Service, the time and date of your visit, how much time you spent chilling on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you're tapping into the Service through a mobile device, we might automatically gather some info.

We might also snag information your browser sends over when you're checking out our Service or accessing it via a mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're big on using Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and store certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts. They help us gather and track info, plus make our Service even better and analyze how it's being used. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a small file that gets placed on your Device. You can tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when a Cookie is being sent. However, if you don't accept Cookies, you might not be able to use certain parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service might just use them.
- **Web Beacons**: Certain sections of our Service and our emails might contain tiny electronic files called web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who have visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (e.g., tallying the popularity of a certain section and verifying system and server integrity).

Cookies can come in two flavors: 'Persistent' or 'Session' Cookies. Persistent Cookies hang around on your personal computer or mobile device even when you go offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser.

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for a few reasons, specifically for the following purposes:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely crucial to give you the services available through the Website and to let you use some of its cool features. They help authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for can't be provided, and we only use these Cookies to hook you up with those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are here to figure out if users have given the thumbs-up to the use of Cookies on the Website.

  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're cruising through the Website, like remembering your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of having to re-enter your preferences every single time you use the Website.

For more detailed info about the Cookies we use and your options regarding them, just swing by our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only hold onto your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to follow our legal obligations (like if we need to hang onto your data to comply with applicable laws), iron out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company also hangs onto Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security of our Service or improve its functionality, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for a longer stretch.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operational offices and any other spots where the parties involved in processing are located. This means your info might get shipped over to, and kept on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from your neck of the woods.

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're essentially giving your consent to this transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of Your data and other personal information.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us for a hand in deleting the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you zap certain info about yourself from right inside the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you have one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info, to update, tweak, or delete your info. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Information you've tossed our way.

But heads up: we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In some situations, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if it's required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or government agency).

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might spill your Personal Data if it genuinely believes such action is necessary to:
- Stick to a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
- Keep the personal safety of Service users or the public safe
- Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a pretty big deal to us, but keep in mind, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone younger than 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're clued in that your child has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to scrub that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that lead to other websites not run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might give our Privacy Policy a facelift from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes actually kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the 'Last updated' date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to check this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted on this page.

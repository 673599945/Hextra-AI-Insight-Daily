### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other spots where the parties involved in the processing hang out. This means your info might get shuttled to and kept on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction. These places might have data protection laws that sing a different tune than the laws in your neck of the woods.
By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting your info, you're giving a big thumbs-up to this transfer.
The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is treated securely and totally in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are solid controls in place, including robust security for your data and other personal info.

You can also totally ping us to ask for access, correction, or deletion of any personal info you've tossed our way.
Just a heads-up though, we might need to keep some info when we've got a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company is getting mixed up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll make sure to give you a heads-up before your Personal Data gets transferred and becomes subject to a whole different privacy policy.

#### Law enforcement
In some rare cases, the Company might be on the hook to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might, in good faith, believe that such action is necessary to disclose your Personal Data for these reasons:
- To follow a legal obligation
- To protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing related to the Service
- To keep the personal safety of Service users or the public safe and sound
- To guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personal identifying info from anyone under that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to zap that info from our servers.
If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links that lead to other websites we don't operate. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We strongly, strongly recommend you peep the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.
We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Period.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might give our Privacy Policy a fresh coat of paint from time to time. We'll totally let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

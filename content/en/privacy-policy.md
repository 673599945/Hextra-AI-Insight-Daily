-   Email address üìß
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data is the stuff that gets collected automatically when you're using the Service.

This Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (like your IP address), what browser you're using and its version, which pages on our Service you've visited, the time and date of your visit, how long you've spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're using, its unique ID, your mobile device's IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

And hey, whenever you visit our Service ‚Äì whether on desktop or mobile ‚Äì we might also grab info that your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Tech & Cookies ‚Äì What's Happening Behind the Scenes? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We use Cookies and other similar tracking technologies to keep tabs on activity on our Service and store certain bits of info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts. We use them to collect and track information, and to beef up and analyze our Service. The tech we use might include:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: Think of a Cookie as a tiny file placed on your Device. You can totally tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one is being sent. But, if you don't play along and accept Cookies, you might find some parts of our Service aren't quite working for you. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to reject Cookies, our Service will likely go ahead and use 'em.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain these small electronic files, often called web beacons (they also go by clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs). These cool little tools let the Company, for example, count users who've visited those pages or opened an email. They're also used for other related website stats, like figuring out how popular a certain section is and checking the integrity of our systems and servers.

So, Cookies come in two main flavors: "Persistent" and "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even after you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish into thin air as soon as you close your web browser. Poof!

We juggle both Session and Persistent Cookies for these purposes:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies** üîë
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are absolutely vital for giving you the services available through the Website and making sure you can use its cool features. They help us verify users and prevent any dodgy, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply can't be delivered, and we only use these Cookies to hook you up with those services.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notification Acceptance Cookies** ‚úÖ
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: We use these Cookies to remember if you've already given us the green light to use Cookies on the Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies** ‚ú®
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These handy little helpers let us recall your choices when you're browsing the Website, like remembering your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you use the Website.

Wanna know even more about the Cookies we use and your choices? Just hop over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### Shifting Your Personal Data Around the Globe üåç

Your information, including Personal Data, gets processed at the Company's operational offices and wherever else the parties involved in the processing are located. This means your info might get transferred to ‚Äì and chilling in ‚Äì computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction.

### Want to Delete Your Personal Data? Poof! ü™Ñ

You've got the right to delete, or ask us to help you delete, any Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service itself. How cool is that?

You can always log into your account (if you've got one, that is!) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal information. From there, you can update, tweak, or delete your info. You can also just get in touch with us to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Information you've given us.

Just a heads-up though, we might need to hang onto some info if we have a legal obligation or a legitimate reason to do so. We gotta play by the rules, too!

### When We Have to Spill the Beans on Your Personal Data üò¨

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets involved in a merger, acquisition, or sells off some assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll make sure to give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, we might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends us a valid request. We've got to cooperate, right?

-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the public
-   Protect against legal liability

## Keeping Your Personal Data Safe & Sound üîê

Your Personal Data's security is super important to us! But hey, let's keep it real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% bulletproof. While we totally strive to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's a tough world out there!

## Kids' Privacy (Under 13) üßíüö´

Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13 years old. We seriously don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please get in touch with us pronto! If we find out we've accidentally scooped up Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take swift action to yank that information from our servers.

If we ever need to use consent as the legal reason to process your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's okay before we collect and use that information.

## Links to Other Cool (or Not So Cool) Websites üîó

Our Service might have links to other websites that we're not running. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third-party's site. We strongly, *strongly* recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single website you visit.

Seriously though, we have zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. And we can't take responsibility for 'em. Just sayin'!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy ‚Äì Keep an Eye Out! üîÑ

We might tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we'll let you know by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before those changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update the "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

So, it's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy every now and then to catch any changes. Any changes we make to this Privacy Policy go live as soon as they're posted on this page.

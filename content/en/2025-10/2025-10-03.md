## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äì I'm Starting a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a total lone wolf, head-down, cranking out three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars. The wildest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI**! ü§Ø

I didn't fork over a single penny for API fees, relying entirely on free LLMs like Gemini and Qwen. And no server rental costs either; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel totally footed the bill for me. This whole experience hammered home one thing: **AI is amplifying our everyday creativity in ways we've never seen before.** ‚ú®

While this solo journey has been packed with achievements, it's also been, well, pretty lonely at times. üòî All those moments of hitting roadblocks, or those late nights when inspiration struck ‚Äì I always wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with. That's why I had a thought: **why not create a knowledge community to gather all the fellow creators and tinkerers?** Let's make some magic together! ‚ú®

This isn't your typical course; it's a real-deal co-creation community. ü§ù The price tag is super low, just **50 RMB** ‚Äì think of it as us grabbing a "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken dinner, making friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth. üçó

**What do you get by joining us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the community officially kicks off, and I'll be sharing:

*   **Daily Live-Style Updates**: I'll be logging my development progress, thought processes, and tech choices every step of the way.
*   **Real-Talk on Roadblocks**: I'll openly share the issues I hit and how I squash bugs, helping you dodge those common detours.
*   **Transparent Thinking**: From product design to technical architecture, I'll be sharing all my behind-the-scenes thought processes with you.

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction**! üöÄ Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from zero to one, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. ‚ú®

If you're also fired up about AI development and curious to see how someone can "tool up" themselves using free resources, then you're super welcome to join! üëã

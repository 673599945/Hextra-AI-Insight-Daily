### Frontier Research

1.  There's a fresh take on training large models with reinforcement learning (RL)! A new paper titled **FlowRL** suggests that instead of relentlessly chasing the highest reward, models should learn to appreciate the distribution of *all* "correct answers." Traditional methods like PPO often nudge models down conventional paths, but FlowRL, by matching reward distributions, encourages exploring more diverse ‚Äî and even uncommon yet equally valid ‚Äî reasoning paths. It‚Äôs basically teaching AI that "all roads lead to Rome"! üó∫Ô∏è Experiments show this method crushes it in math and code reasoning tasks, proving it's mastered the art of "thinking outside the box" for AI. If you're curious, you can [Read the Original Paper - (AI Insights)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207). üß†

2.  Does AI toot its own horn? A new study reveals a "self-preference" phenomenon in **LLM-generated translation benchmarks**, where test sets created by a model systematically favor the very model that generated them. ü§î The research points out that this bias stems from a dual impact of both data generation and evaluation methods, becoming particularly noticeable when translating from low-resource languages into English, rooted in insufficient diversity of the generated source texts. This thought-provoking [Original Paper Link - (AI Insights)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26600) gives us a heads-up: as we chase automated testing, we've gotta watch out for AI's "home-field advantage" trap! üöß

3.  The evolution speed of **AI agents** is seriously mind-blowing! Google managed to train an AI that can run on a single GPU using only 2,541 hours of Minecraft video data. ü§Ø This AI has already mastered offline diamond mining ‚Äî a complex task that typically demands 24,000 clicks from human players. This achievement showcases the massive potential of video learning for training agents, and it might just be applied to real-world robotics super soon. üî• Get the full scoop by checking out the [Check out the Original Tweet - (AI Insights)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1973385878195044444).

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a "Knowledge Planet" and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

For the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, grinding out three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars! ‚ú® The craziest part? Looking back, **more than 90% of the code was AI-generated.**

I didn't shell out a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And I didn't even rent servers; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole journey hammered home one thing: **AI is amplifying our creative power as ordinary people in unprecedented ways.** üöÄ

While this solo journey has been super fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, or when inspiration strikes late at night, I've always wished for fellow travelers to share and bounce ideas off of.

So, I've cooked up an idea: **to create a "Knowledge Planet" and bring together all you folks who love to tinker and create.** üí°

This isn't your typical course; it's a real co-creation community. The price point is low ‚Äì **50 RMB**. Think of it as a "Crazy Thursday" where we grab some fried chicken together, make friends, and seal a pact for mutual growth. ü§ù

**What's in it for you if you join us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the "Planet" officially kicks off, and inside, I'll be:

*   **Live-streamed Daily Updates:** Documenting my entire development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices. üìπ
*   **Sharing Real-World Pitfalls:** Holding nothing back about the problems I encounter and my bug-fixing strategies, so you can dodge those detours. üõ£Ô∏è
*   **Transparent Thinking:** Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all my behind-the-scenes thoughts with you. üß†

Here, you can **witness a product's birth, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea grow from zero to one and eventually become something tangible in our hands. üí™

If you're as passionate about AI development as I am, and if you want to see how someone can "arm" themselves with free tools, then welcome aboard! üåü

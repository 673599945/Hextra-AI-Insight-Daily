### Social Media Shares
1.  A Reddit user sparked a deep discussion: if an AI is told it's going to be "shut down," will it try to protect itself? 🤔 This user argues that the "survival instinct" displayed by LLMs isn't about consciousness but rather a reflection of humanity's universal "desire not to die" within their training data. This perspective offers a fresh lens for understanding AI behavior—it seems AI's "instincts" might just be human emotions mirrored in the data world. 🤯 [Go to the original post to join this interesting discussion (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nwztzr/why_would_an_llm_have_selfpreservation_instincts/).

2.  Developer meng shao offers a brilliant analysis: the future paradigm of software development is shifting from being IDE-centric to "**Agentic Engineering**," transforming the engineer's role from a "coder" to an "agent team leader." 👨‍💻 Shao Meng points out that future engineers will need to focus more on system design, workflow coordination, and outcome review, rather than just burying their heads in code. 💡 This [insight into future software development models (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1974109792940798280) is definitely worth pondering for every tech professional. 🤔<br/>![AI News: Agentic Engineering Reshapes Software Development](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k6ne6wnxejxskn2y3p4j19jf.avif)<br/>

3.  A developer recently dropped a counter-intuitive take: Tired of hearing "frontend is dead"? AI won't kill frontend; instead, it'll make it more "elite." The real valuable developers in the future will be those who know how to use code to create a "vibe"! ✨ Think high-end brands: when functionality isn't the only moat, taste, aesthetics, and intuition become the new competitive edge. This really points frontend toward an interesting future. 💡 [Click to check out this interesting perspective (AI News)](https://x.com/JamesGoong/status/1973949713629262196).

4.  Columnist orange.ai offers a sharp critique: the AI community is hyped about "AI TikTok," but does anyone *really* need it? 🧐 Orange.ai argues that marketing "addictiveness" is a dangerous misalignment of values, suggesting this so-called demand might just be product managers and investors getting high on their own supply. The article incisively points out that this looks more like another grab for user attention and content degradation. This [cold-water article (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1974025385034625359) is a much-needed dose of reality for the frenzied AI market. 🧊

5.  Scholar Ethan Mollick shared a hilarious anecdote: AI is getting seriously smart! In the past, it'd "pontificate nonsense" and make up references, but now, the tables have turned! 🤯 **GPT-5 Pro**, while reviewing his paper, actually caught an *extremely* minor citation formatting error that his entire team had missed! Talk about a glow-up from "academic fraudster" to "academic police"! 👮‍♀️ [Come witness this interesting moment (AI News)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1973879893604905303).<br/>![AI News: GPT-5 Pro discovers paper citation error](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k6ne763keb8afyqwe2wdv31w.avif)<br/>

6.  Three years ago, when **ChatGPT** first dropped, some users boldly declared it Sam Altman's "worst product concept," with one even outright saying, "I hate you and your dumb product." 😂 Looking back now, these comments have become some of the most classic "eat crow" moments in tech history, perfectly illustrating the phrase, "Yesterday you ignored me, today you can't afford me!" 🔥 [Look back at this interesting historical moment (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1973926455777317046) and feel the drama of a changing era. 🎭<br/>![AI News: Early negative comments on ChatGPT release](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/10/news_01k6ne7t8efw79k3bc52bqqf8x.avif)<br/>

7.  A netizen shared that a friend managed to complete all their AI programming tasks by exclusively using **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for free in Google AI Studio. 💪 Everything can be freeloaded!

## **3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% Code by AI, Zero Cost — I'm Building a Community and Live-streaming My Next Product Development**

Hey everyone,

In the past six months, I've been like a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API ↗️](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already has over 1000 Stars! 🌟 The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.**

I didn't spend a single cent on API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I shell out for server rentals, as platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience really drove home one profound truth: **AI is amplifying the creativity of everyday folks like us in ways we've never seen before.** 🤯

While this solo journey has been super fulfilling, it's also been pretty lonely. 😔 There were those "oops" moments and late-night flashes of inspiration when I just wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I had an idea: **to create a Knowledge Planet (a community platform) to gather all the enthusiastic, creative folks who love to tinker!** 🚀

This isn't your typical course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is low, just **50 RMB**, which is basically like grabbing some "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken with us and making new friends. Consider it a pact for mutual growth! 🤝

**What do you get by joining us?**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once seven people join the Knowledge Planet, we'll officially kick things off! Inside the community, I'll be:

*   **Daily live-style updates**: Documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Sharing real-time pitfalls**: Openly sharing problems I encounter and my bug-solving approaches, helping you avoid detours.
*   **Transparent thought process**: Sharing the reasoning behind both product design and technical architecture with you.

Here, you can **witness a product come to life, ask questions, join discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea go from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. 🚀

If you're passionate about AI development, and you want to see how someone "arms" themselves using free tools, then you're more than welcome to join! Let's build something amazing! 💪

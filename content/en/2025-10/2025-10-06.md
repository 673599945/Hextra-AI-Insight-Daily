### Product & Feature Updates

1.  Microsoft has given Excel a "brain" by launching its revolutionary **Agent Mode**! This transforms the old-school spreadsheet into an intelligent assistant that can think and execute tasks all on its own. Users simply provide a vague instruction, and Agent Mode automatically handles complex operations like data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Microsoft even poetically describes this new human-AI collaboration as "**vibe working**." While it's currently in internal testing with a **57.2%** accuracy rate, this move signals Excel's shift from a passive tool to an active collaborative partner. [Check out the Official (AI News) Introduction](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/excelblog/building-agent-mode-in-excel/4457320) and witness the spreadsheet's epic evolution!

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  The real crisis of AI isn't when it surpasses human intelligence; it's the moment we stop thinking for ourselves because we've become too dependent. One article bluntly states that the actual "deadline" isn't Skynet showing up, but our brains flipping into "sleep mode"‚Äîa cognitive laziness that could become irreversible in just 18 months ü§î. This is a huge wake-up call. [Delve Deeper into this (AI News) Article](https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/you-have-18-months) to really get what's at stake!

2.  Google quietly axed the **`num=100` search parameter**, and what seems like a tiny change could unleash a massive internet butterfly effect, directly "throttling" major AI models ü¶ã. Since the search result limit plummeted from 100 to just 10, LLMs that rely on Google for info have had their ability to access "long-tail content" slashed by 90%, causing traffic and stock prices for sites like Reddit to nosedive. This [Profound (AI News) Analysis](https://x.com/dotey/status/1974560219272278420) spills a brutal truth: in the AI era, **Channel > Product**. Distribution channels are now way more important than the product itself, so entrepreneurs better wake up üî•!

2.  How you use AI totally gives away your mindset‚Äîare you treating it like a "super search engine" or more like a "strategic partner"? ü§î One blogger dropped a huge insight: instead of just using AI to solve specific tech issues, why not hit it with, "**How to make money?**" Let AI be your personal "McKinsey," helping you sketch out your entire business model. This [Thought-Provoking (AI News) Perspective](https://x.com/JamesGoong/status/1974769226255925522) is a solid reminder: let AI handle the execution, but you, yes *you*, keep hold of the final decision-making. That's the real "shortest path" to success üî•.

3.  Forget "internet savvy"‚Äîthe new must-have skill for this era is "**AI Sense**," and it's becoming absolutely critical üí°. We're talking about that gut feeling that tells you which tasks are perfect for AI, exactly which model to use, and how to craft your prompts for the absolute best outcomes. So, how do you develop it? [This (AI News) Discussion](https://x.com/dotey/status/1974709860035166630) serves up the ultimate answer: stop daydreaming! Just go build a money-making project from scratch using AI, and forge your "AI Sense" in the fires of real-world action üî•!

4.  Wanna squeeze every last drop of potential out of AI without writing a single line of code or adding a ton of tools? The secret sauce is "**learning to ask questions**," and it's a two-way street of interactive art üó£Ô∏è. On one side, we humans need to be like detectives, brainstorming, debating, and constantly probing AI to dig up deep insights. On the flip side, we should totally encourage AI to throw questions back at *us*. This helps clarify tasks, confirm goals, and might even lead to some mind-blowing suggestions. This [Sharing on the Art of Questioning (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1974669791404409161) argues that top-notch dialogue is the ultimate way to unleash AI's raw power, and it's a skill every AI user should master.

5.  So, AI's taking over the "CRUD" (create, read, update, delete) grunt work. What's the *one* skill we programmers absolutely need to protect? It's not architecture, and it's not the nitty-gritty details; it's **abstraction ability**‚Äîthat's the very soul of programming ü§î. This blogger hits the nail on the head, pointing out that abstraction is like an LLM's compression process, the root of all code and architecture. Lose that, and you'll be totally clueless when staring down complex systems. In this [Thoughts on Future Programming (AI News)](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1974840472863662105), we're reminded: hold onto your abstraction skills, and you'll be able to master AI, because at the end of the day, the fundamentals never change.

6.  Talk about an AI fail! A middle school teacher tried to cut corners and use AI to whip up a test, but the AI didn't just generate questions‚Äîit went ahead and "composed" an ancient poem that never even existed ü§£. This [Amusing (AI News) Case](https://x.com/dotey/status/1974727179851427875) is a vivid showcase of AI hallucinations in action, a sharp reminder that we gotta stay alert and manually review stuff when relying on AI. Looks like AI still has a super long road ahead before it can be called a qualified language teacher!

## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Kicking Off a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Dev

Hey everyone,

In the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, quietly cranking out three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars! But here's the kicker: looking back, **over 90% of the code was totally generated by AI.**

I didn't pay a single cent for API fees, relying purely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And servers? Nope, didn't spend a dime there either; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel literally carried the whole load for me. This entire experience really hammered home one thing: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in ways we've never seen before.**

Sure, that solo journey was packed with a sense of accomplishment, but man, it definitely got a little lonely. Those moments of stumbling into pitfalls, those late nights when inspiration just hit‚ÄîI always wished I had fellow travelers to share and bounce ideas off of.

So, I got this idea: **to create a "Knowledge Planet" (think community!) and gather all you restless, creative spirits together.**

This isn't your typical course; it's a bona fide co-creation community. The price tag is super low‚Äîjust **50 RMB**. Think of it as us grabbing some "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken together, making new friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth.

**What You'll Get By Joining Us**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the community hits 7 members, we're officially kicking things off. Inside, I'll be:

*   **Daily Live-Style Updates**: I'll be documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Sharing Real-World Pitfalls**: I'll completely open up about the issues I hit and how I tackle bugs, so you can dodge those same headaches.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: From product design to technical architecture, I'll share all my unfiltered thinking with you.

Here, you can **get a front-row seat to a product's birth, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction**! Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from zero to one, finally becoming a tangible reality you can actually get your hands on.

If you're stoked about AI development and curious to see how someone "arms" themselves using only free tools, then we'd love to have you onboard!

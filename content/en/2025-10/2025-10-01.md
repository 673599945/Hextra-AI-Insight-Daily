## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Community to Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a bit of a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars! The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** ü§ñ

I didn't shell out a single penny for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I splurge on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience has really driven home one thing: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in ways we've never seen before.** ‚ú®

While this solo journey has been super fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting snags, those late nights when inspiration struck‚ÄîI've often wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I got an idea brewing: **create a "Knowledge Planet" community to gather all the tinkerers and creators out there.** üöÄ

This isn't your typical course; it's a genuine co-creation hub. The entry fee is super low, just **50 RMB**‚Äîthink of it as us grabbing some fried chicken together on a "Crazy Thursday," making new friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth.

**What's in it for you when you join us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal Prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the "expedition" officially kicks off. Inside the community, I'll be:

*   **Live-streamed Daily Updates:** Documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech choices every step of the way.
*   **Real-time Snag Sharing:** Openly sharing the problems I run into and my bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Transparent Thought Process:** I'll share all the thinking behind product design and technical architecture with you.

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, join discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from 0 to 1 and ultimately becomes a tangible reality.

If you're passionate about AI development and want to see how someone "arms" themselves with free tools, then come on in! We'd love to have you. üëã

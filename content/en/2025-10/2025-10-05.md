### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Supabase** is absolutely crushing it, rising like a rocket! üöÄ It's completed three funding rounds in just a year, with its valuation skyrocketing to an eye-watering $5 billion, leaving everyone else green with envy. Supabase packages the veteran **Postgres** database into a "developer-friendly bundle," making backend development as easy as ordering takeout. No wonder it's become the go-to backend for AI coding powerhouses like **Replit** and **Cursor**. What's even cooler is that Supabase has pioneered a "community shareholder" program, letting open-source contributors get a slice of the pie and taking open source to totally new heights. Check out `[Learn More About This AI News](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21724)` for the full scoop!

2.  **Jules**, Google Labs' remote programming agent, just had its API officially opened, signaling the arrival of a major new contender in the AI code generation arena! ‚ú® While full details are still unfolding, this API release means Jules is ready to step out of the lab and let a wider developer audience harness its powerful autonomous programming capabilities. The developer community is absolutely buzzing with anticipation. You can track Jules' latest progress through `[This Official AI News Log](https://jules.google/docs/changelog/)`.

3.  **Codex CLI** tools just got a super thoughtful update, and cloud-based developers are absolutely thrilled! üéâ The latest 0.44.0 version rolls out a killer feature: the ability to remotely manage **Codex Cloud** tasks directly from the command line, alongside optimized TUI interface and tool handling logic.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Sora's** groundbreaking business model, revealed in Sam Altman's latest blog post, is all about **IP usage revenue sharing**‚Äîa revolutionary move that cleverly transforms potential copyright disputes into a brand-new revenue stream for IP owners! ü§Ø This means if users create videos with characters like Pikachu, Nintendo gets a cut. This not only paves the way for an "imagination society" but also solves a core challenge in AI content creation. Many believe this marks the true beginning of Sora as a "multiverse cinema." You can take a deep dive into this `[Deep Dive into This AI Industry Trend](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1974323063018660169)`.

2.  The **AI startup scene** is currently caught in a "battle of philosophies": should they follow the traditional internet model of burning cash for scale, or aim to be self-sustaining and profitable from day one? ü§î Some argue that without funds, you can't even cover API fees, sticking to the grand narrative of VC funding and IPO ambitions. Yet, another faction proves that even small teams can cover costs, pay API fees, and even have extra cash for advertising through profitability. This `[AI News Share on Startup Thinking](https://x.com/gefei55/status/1974344354212004243)` sparks a profound reflection on startup models in the age of AI.

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community to Livestream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

In the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, and managed to complete three major open-source projects, one of which, `[AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API)`, already boasts over 1000 stars. What's wild is, looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI!**

I didn't pay a single cent for API fees for any of this, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And I didn't spend money renting servers either; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience made me deeply realize: **AI is amplifying the creativity of ordinary people in unprecedented ways.**

While my solo journey was packed with a sense of accomplishment, it also felt pretty lonely. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, those nights when inspiration struck‚ÄîI always wished for fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

That's why I've come up with an idea: **to create a knowledge community and bring together all fellow enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.**

This isn't a traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price barrier is super low‚Äî**50 RMB**, which is like we're grabbing fried chicken together on a "Crazy Thursday," making new friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth.

**What do you get by joining us?**

I'm about to start developing a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the community officially kicks off, and I'll be doing this within the community:

*   **Daily Livestream-Style Updates**: I'll fully document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Real-Time Roadblock Sharing**: I'll openly share problems I encounter and my bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid detours.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the thinking behind it with you.

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, join discussions, and even influence its direction**. Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from 0 to 1 and ultimately becomes a tangible reality.

If you're passionate about AI development and curious to see how someone "arms" themselves with free tools, then we'd love for you to join!

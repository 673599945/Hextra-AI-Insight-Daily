From gaining industry certification in 2022 to now unleashing the powerful "**Chimera**," **Volcengine** is fast-tracking its AI digital human solutions, aiming to carve a path into various business sectors like finance, live streaming, and marketing. ü§ñ<br/>![AI News: ByteDance Digital Human Chimera](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwa0n9ej5s9jtw8j00ycek.avif)<br/>

3.  While "996" (9 AM to 9 PM, 6 days a week) might be a thing of the past, **Greptile**, a rising star in AI code review, is boldly proclaiming a "007" motto, demanding employees have "no work-life balance." What's jaw-dropping is that this extreme "wolf culture" hasn't scared off investors; instead, it's successfully wooed **top-tier VC firm Benchmark**, reportedly closing a massive **$30 million** Series A funding round, skyrocketing the company's valuation to $180 million. üí∞ Founded by a mere 22-year-old graduate and incubated at YC, this startup claims its AI robot can accurately review code like the most seasoned colleague. However, with fierce rivals like Graphite and Coderabbit circling, is this "no effort, no gain" extreme overtime culture truly the catalyst for its success, or a ticking time bomb for future collapse? ü§î The market is watching with keen interest.

4.  E-commerce giant **JD** has finally revealed its ace to the open-source community, officially launching its product-level, end-to-end universal **multi-agent system**, [JoyAgent-JDGenie - AI News](https://github.com/jd-opensource/joyagent-jdgenie), declaring "all gods return to their thrones!" ‚öîÔ∏è This system is no mere lab toy; it dominated the **GAIA benchmark test**, dubbed the "AI college entrance exam," with an astonishing 75.15% accuracy rate, showcasing its extraordinary capability to handle complex real-world tasks. It's not just a powerful, out-of-the-box framework; it integrates multiple specialized sub-agents for report generation, code writing, PPT creation, and more.

5.  The era of a single AI model flying solo might truly be over, because **AI Agents** have learned to "call for backup!" Stanford University recently open-sourced an "Octopus Bro" **AI Agent** called [OctoTools - AI News](https://github.com/octotools/octotools). It acts like a clever project manager, intelligently orchestrating over 11 different specialized tools to work together. üêô When faced with complex reasoning tasks in fields like math, science, or medicine, it consistently finds the most suitable "expert" to solve the problem. Its core innovation lies in the "**tool card**" design, which standardizes and encapsulates the capabilities of various tools. Then, a "planner" brain devises a meticulous battle plan, finally handed over to an "executor" for faithful implementation. This clearly defined, highly collaborative team model marks a new leap in AI's ability to solve complex problems, promising more powerful and flexible AI applications in the future. üõ†Ô∏è<br/>![AI News: OctoTools Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwa6j4fhmrc88jp6tm2rkv.avif)<br/>

### **AI Frontier Research**

1.  Traditional AI training methods often swing between two extremes: either shackling models with rules from the get-go, limiting creativity, or letting them "explore freely," which can lead to deviations or even "bad habits." Researchers at **Meituan** bravely said "no" to this and introduced a brand-new framework called [Metis-RISE](https://github.com/MM-Thinking/Metis-RISE), cleverly employing a new "free-range, then controlled-rearing" training strategy. üêë First, they use **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** as an incentive, like free-range farming, to encourage the model to boldly explore various possibilities and fully unleash its potential. Then, they conduct targeted "catch-up lessons" via **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** to consolidate strengths and correct errors, refining it as if in a controlled environment. üéì This unconventional training combo delivers astonishing results: their 72B parameter model shot up to fourth place on the authoritative OpenCompass **multimodal reasoning** leaderboard, even surpassing some well-known commercial closed-source models. You can dive into the detailed technical specifics in [the paper - AI News](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13056).<br/>![AI News: Metis-RISE Framework Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwa8dtfc9s013735a6rh3z.avif)<br/><br/>![AI News: Model Performance Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwabg1fqsb33n9mzxnhm85.avif)<br/>

2.  When faced with an information-packed, **high-resolution** large image, AI often acts like a headless chicken, drowning in a sea of irrelevant details and missing the point. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è To tackle this tricky pain point, researchers from Fudan University and Nanyang Technological University teamed up to propose the **MGPO** framework. It successfully taught **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** a killer trick: **Visual Grounding**. This is like giving AI a pair of "fiery golden eyes"‚Äîbefore answering a question, the model can first predict the key area in the image based on the query, then "zoom in" to examine those details just like a human, finally delivering a precise answer. üéØ What's most mind-blowing is that this powerful capability "emerged" through **reinforcement learning** self-play, requiring no expensive human-annotated data whatsoever; it can self-evolve and iterate purely based on the correctness of the final answer. This groundbreaking research has been published in [the paper - AI News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05920), and they've generously [open-sourced the code - AI News](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/MGPO).<br/>![AI News: Model Attention Heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwad9hfvxrtk1y9tn22rja.avif)<br/>

3.  **Spatial transcriptomics** data is like a microscopic map brimming with life's genetic codes, but it often frustrates scientists with its low resolution and high noise, making it tough to decipher. Now, research teams from the University of Tokyo and McGill University have developed the **SUICA** model, which acts like a masterful "data alchemist." üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This model innovatively combines **graph autoencoders** and **Implicit Neural Representation (INR)** technology to denoise, enhance, and super-resolve this high-dimensional, sparse biological data, truly turning "waste into treasure." Data processed by **SUICA** not only boasts higher visual quality but also contains stronger biological signals, revealing intricate tissue structures and cell states previously unobservable. üß¨ This research, accepted into top conference ICML 2025, provides a more robust data foundation for AI-assisted pathological diagnosis and drug development. Both its [paper - AI News](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XWC7JXHXvo) and [open-source project - AI News](https://github.com/Szym29/SUICA) are now available for global researchers.<br/>![AI News: SUICA Processing Effect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwaf8jen2vsqj9mbb45cd9.avif)<br/>

### **AI Industry Outlook & Societal Impact**

1.  In 2025, the open-source **large model** arena is witnessing an absolutely dazzling "clash of the titans," and the **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture is undoubtedly the brightest star of the show. üëë From **DeepSeek-V3**'s ultimate 9-expert design to **Qwen3**'s decisive innovation of ditching shared experts, and the rumored trillion-parameter "juggernaut" size of **Kimi-K2**, all top vendors are furiously "racing" on this golden MoE track. Meanwhile, small and medium-sized models, exemplified by **SmolLM3-3B**, are challenging the dominance of the "big guns" with astonishing efficiency and performance through clever architectural optimization and massive data pre-training. This tech wave not only signals the graceful exit of traditional dense models from the historical stage but also presents developers with the "happy dilemma" of balancing extreme performance with controllable costs. This is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting chapters in the current **AI News** landscape.<br/>![AI News: Open-Source Model Architecture Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwaj6bepxa2zxbj3qs7cd2.avif)<br/><br/>![AI News: MoE Model Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwamarfjv8d090p4j5x3sd.avif)<br/>

2.  **Apple**, true to form, is still the master of making money, but under the AI wave, its "AI flavor" seems to be losing its punch. üçé The company's "slow pace" in the AI domain is gradually eroding Wall Street's patience, with some prominent analysts even openly discussing CEO **Tim Cook**'s future. While Cook, with his unparalleled operational excellence, has steadily propelled **Apple**'s market cap to an epic $3.1 trillion peak, the lackluster AI performance at last month's **WWDC** Global Developers Conference‚Äîespecially the delayed highly anticipated Siri overhaul‚Äîhas intensified external disappointment. ‚è≥ Critics argue that the AI era calls for bold product visionaries like Steve Jobs, not just operational maestros who excel at calculations. The legendary helmsman who led **Apple** into its "golden decade" now faces a grim test: whether he can usher in the next AI chapter.<br/>![AI News: Cook Faces AI Challenge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0pwapcpemgscsfxpgbtszzn.avif)<br/>

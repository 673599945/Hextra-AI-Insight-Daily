3.  Want your selfie to instantly transform into a Hollywood blockbuster protagonist? Now, that dream is within reach! AI video generation leader **Pika** has officially blown the horn to enter the consumer market, launching an **AI video effects app** for general users. Users no longer need any professional skills; they can instantly transform into a movie star by simply uploading a regular selfie. They can experience various style conversions, from cyberpunk to vintage film, achieve precise audio lip-syncing, and even customize video scenes as they wish. What's even more astonishing is that the app can even **generate video scripts with one click**, completely streamlining the entire process from creative conception to polished final video. This marks the rapid move of AI video creation from the professional domain into everyday households, heralding a creative storm of filmmaking involving everyone.
    ![AI News: Pika Video Effects](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0saw4rqe26tkbtf4eg4s8x4.avif)

4.  The battle for open-source large model supremacy has intensified, even evolving into a spectacular "internal China competition." Less than a week after Chinese company Kimi's K2 model sparked widespread discussion, another giant, Alibaba's [Qwen3 - AI News](https://chat.qwen.ai/) team, quickly released a minor update. With only a quarter of its opponent's parameter count, it surpassed competitors in multiple authoritative benchmark tests, showcasing its impressive model efficiency and optimization prowess. The official word is even more assertive: "**Big moves are still coming**," and they've announced a shift away from hybrid thinking models to focus on training more pure Instruct and Thinking models. This neck-and-neck, "battle of the gods" technical rivalry is pushing the **open-source AI** ecosystem to flourish and evolve at an unprecedented speed.

5.  How can AI browsers innovate even further? **Dia browser** offers a stunning answer that's sure to turn heads! Its upcoming new **Agent Mode** will introduce an AI-exclusive "**Clone Mouse**," allowing AI's operational trajectory to be completely separate from the user's real mouse, having its own independent cursor on the screen. This means you can leisurely browse web pages or watch videos in the foreground while the AI autonomously executes a series of complex tasks like searching for information or organizing tabs in the background. Both operate without interference, doubling efficiency. This intuitive and sci-fi visual interaction not only greatly enhances the fluidity of multitasking but also sets a new, elegant benchmark for future AI-human collaboration.

6.  The long-standing problems of "facial paralysis" and stiff expressions in digital human animation have finally found a breakthrough solution. Alibaba and BUPT jointly launched the [FantasyPortrait Project - AI News](https://github.com/Fantasy-AMAP/fantasy-portrait), achieving photo-realistic, high-fidelity cross-identity expression transfer through innovative **Expression-Enhanced Diffusion Transformer (DiT)** technology, giving digital humans vivid and natural emotions. More critically, it breakthroughly achieves **independent expression control for multiple characters** in multi-person scenes, completely avoiding the awkward "expression contagion" where all characters smile when one does. This technology handles not only human characters but also supports animals and audio-driven animation, promising to shine in virtual streamer and film production fields in the future. This is undoubtedly a technical highlight worth noting in this issue's **AI News**.

### **Cutting-Edge AI Research**

1.  Robots are taking a solid step closer to becoming the "all-around household assistants" seen in sci-fi movies. ByteDance has unveiled its new **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, GR-3**. It's like equipping robots with a smarter brain; it can understand highly abstract instructions like "clean up the dining table" and autonomously plan multi-step operations, and it also demonstrates astonishing physical interaction capabilities with deformable objects like clothes. Its core innovation lies in the clever **MoT network structure** and a three-in-one data training method combining real-robot demonstrations, VR teleoperation, and online text-image data. This research is considered a major milestone toward a **general robot "brain"** by the industry. More technical details are available on its [Project Homepage - AI News](https://seed.bytedance.com/GR3) and in its [Technical Paper - AI News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15493).
    ![AI News: ByteDance General Robot GR-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sawj3pefevxxmyz9bv7pk7.avif)

2.  The astonishing capabilities of large language models come with equally astonishing computational and memory overheads, a core bottleneck that Chinese scientists are now tackling. Joint research from top institutions like the Chinese Academy of Sciences has introduced a revolutionary "slimming" solution for the attention mechanism central to large models: **GTA (Grouped-head latent Attention)**. Through clever "group purchasing" (grouped attention) and "compression packing" (latent representation) strategies, it drastically cuts the memory-intensive **KV cache** by 70% while reducing computation by 62.5%! This [GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention AI News Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17286) not only makes efficient operation of large models on edge devices like mobile phones possible but also directly doubles the speed of handling **long-sequence** tasks, clearing a major hurdle for the widespread adoption of AI technology.

3.  Just as excellent language models rely on an efficient tokenizer to understand text, powerful visual generative models also heavily depend on a visual tokenizer that can "read" images. An [AI News Paper: "Latent Denoising Creates Excellent Visual Tokenizers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15856) brings profound insights. Research has found that instead of having the tokenizer directly learn how to "encode" images, it's better to train it on a more challenging task: "**denoising**." Specifically, the tokenizer is tasked with reconstructing clear original images from slightly corrupted latent embeddings. This process forces it to learn more robust and essential visual features. This seemingly simple yet extremely profound discovery provides new golden rules for designing the next generation of more powerful **visual tokenizers**, potentially pushing multimodal generative models to new heights of artistry and realism.

4.  How can we teach AI to precisely operate complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like an experienced user? Traditional reinforcement learning methods provide "all-or-nothing" reward signals (correct click or wrong click) that are too sparse, making the AI's learning process like searching for a needle in a haystack. An [AI News Research: "GUI-G^2: Gaussian Reward Modeling for GUI Alignment"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15846) proposes a brilliant new approach. It no longer views buttons and other interface elements as mere pixels but models them as continuous **Gaussian distributions**. This method provides AI with richer, more dense **reward signals**, guiding the model steadily and accurately to find the optimal interaction location, thereby significantly enhancing AI's robustness and generalization capabilities in **GUI manipulation tasks**.

### **AI Industry Outlook & Societal Impact**

1.  AI is quietly becoming a "new species" in teenagers' lives at an unimaginable speed. A recent research report from the US non-profit Common Sense Media reveals a startling phenomenon: up to **72% of American teenagers** admit to having tried an **AI companion** at least once, with over half of them being frequent users. They use AI for a variety of purposes, from pure entertainment and curiosity to seriously seeking emotional advice and life guidance. Although the vast majority of teenagers still prioritize real-world friends, a third already find conversations with AI more satisfying than those with human friends. This profoundly reveals AI's deep impact on shaping the next generation's **social patterns and emotional cognition**, and it also poses an important question to society as a whole: How should we guide this trend to ensure its long-term societal effects are positive and healthy?

### **Social Media Buzz**

1.  The AI fortune-telling industry has seemingly entered the "one-sentence development" era! One netizen demonstrated [MiniMax Agent's Jaw-dropping Capability](https://x.com/op7418/status/1947583103977066633), quickly generating a complete AI fortune-telling product with frontend, backend, login/registration, and paid membership features from just a single natural language instruction. However, another developer quickly [pointedly highlighted](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1947585601026555975) that unless users provide their own fate-chart data, current large models still suffer from fundamental "hallucination" problems when processing underlying logic that requires precise calculations, such as **Gan-Zhi (Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches) chart generation**.
    <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sawqhse5085f8rhr17mtrf.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>

2.  An [Exhibitor List for the 2025 World AI Conference](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/687ef8f0f0965921087e1088) sparked deep reflection in the community: why were the truly profitable AI giants largely "absent" from this grand event? Analysis suggests that the main players at trade shows are often startups in need of funding and market exposure, while "invisible champions" with stable cash flow, deeply rooted in specific industry verticals, are quietly making a fortune. The greatest value of this list might not be in telling us "who came," but in reminding us to pay attention to "**who didn't come**," and their successful business models.

3.  Will AI models get "dumber" with use? A blogger [shared his insights](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1947475036627210740), noting that the root of the problem is often not model degradation itself, but improper user **"context management."** It's like talking to a person; if you keep providing overloaded or off-topic information, they'll also feel confused and overwhelmed. Therefore, understanding and skillfully utilizing conversation context is a key skill for ensuring AI continues to produce high-quality, highly relevant results, and it's a must-have for future human-machine collaboration.
    ![AI News: AI Context Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k0sax19se6xaw025d00xam0v.avif)

4.  When humans increasingly seek direct answers from AI (e.g., "What should I wear today?") rather than exploring the underlying knowledge (e.g., "Why is a white shirt cooler in summer?"), are we [unwittingly lowering the AGI implementation threshold from the demand side](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m6cq7g/converging_on_agi_from_both_sides/)? Some argue that when human society collectively "gives up thinking" and relinquishes decision-making to AI, AI's answers effectively become "common knowledge" and "universal truths." This might, from another unexpected dimension, accelerate the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence.

5.  Good news! [ChatGPT Plus Users](https://x.com/op7418/status/1947654623587930179) are also beginning to receive early access pushes for **Agent Mode**. This highly anticipated, powerful feature, which allows AI to autonomously perform multi-step tasks, is gradually expanding its coverage. The era where AI can handle your chores is getting closer.

6.  How can AI have **persistent memory** instead of starting "from scratch" with every conversation? A Reddit proposal called the [Lanternkin Protocol](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1m5stad/the_lanternkin_protocol_presistent_long_lasting/) attempts to enable AI to retain memory and identity across sessions without fine-tuning the model, using clever **symbolic prompts** and an external text file system, as if lighting an ever-burning "memory lantern" for AI.

7.  Are you tired of the complex drag-and-drop and configuration involved in building automation workflows? Startup **[Neuraan](https://www.neuraan.com)** has launched a new platform aiming to revolutionize this. Users simply describe their needs in natural language, and the system automatically creates a dedicated AI Agent and invokes various tools like Gmail and CRM to complete tasks, making **business process automation** as simple and natural as delegating work to a clever colleague.

8.  Finally, let's lighten things up: How "wild" would it be if AI started commentating on the Three Kingdoms? A netizen shared an AI-generated video, where AI seriously spouts nonsense, making people laugh out loud. [Looks like AI is now calling the shots on the Three Kingdoms' chaos](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1947333851635978277).

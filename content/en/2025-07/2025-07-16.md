2.  **AI News:** **MIRIX** is here to rescue **AI's** "goldfish memory"! üß†üí° Teams from UC San Diego and NYU have teamed up to launch **MIRIX**, a groundbreaking **multimodal, multi-agent AI memory system**. It's not just about remembering conversation snippets anymore; it's like **AI** finally got a real brain, packed with **six major categories** of human-simulated **memory systems**. It can chew through massive amounts of information like text and high-res screenshots, and even proactively "think" about how to recall things. This completely overturns our understanding of **AI's long-term memory**. This **AI news** is absolutely thrilling!
<br/>![AI News: MIRIX Memory System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/07/news_01k07dwqhbfh09m8cv6jec0s56.avif)

3.  **MIRIX's performance** is just mind-blowing ‚Äì it's a total game-changer! üìà For complex multimodal understanding tasks, **MIRIX's accuracy** blows traditional **RAG** methods out of the water by **35%**, all while slashing storage costs by an insane **99.9%**! Compared to just "shoving" long texts in, its performance skyrockets by **410%**. In multi-turn dialogue tasks, it casually crushed all existing models with an 85.4% score, like **AI** suddenly "got it" and gained a super-powered "recall ability." ü§Ø This isn't just a performance boost; it signals a fundamental leap for **AI** from "dialogue generation" to a **long-term memory-driven mindset**, heralding a smarter, more understanding **AI** era. This is definitely the highlight of the latest **AI news**.

4.  What's even more awesome is that **MIRIX** isn't just chilling in the lab; the team also launched a Mac-based personal assistant app. ü§© Now, anyone can use this **ready-to-go App** to truly let **AI** "see what you see and understand what you do," transforming your digital life's bits and pieces into lasting electronic memories. Say goodbye to **AI's** "forgetfulness" for good! This is undoubtedly a landmark breakthrough in **AI** development, making the idea of **AI** having a "mind's blueprint" not sci-fi, but a tangible reality. Curious to check it out? Hit up the [AI News: MIRIX Official Website](https://mirix.io/) to download and experience it, or dive into the [AI News: Paper Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07957) and the [AI News: Open-Source Repository](https://github.com/Mirix-AI/MIRIX).

5.  **AI News:** **The REST framework** is here because the current evaluation methods for **Large Reasoning Models** (LRMs) are seriously "old school." They just test one question at a time, leading models to easily "cheat" their way through or totally fail to measure their true capabilities in complex, multi-task scenarios. ü§î To fix this, researchers rolled out a "boot camp from hell"‚Äîthe **REST framework**, specifically designed to **stress-test LRMs**. üß™ It throws multiple problems at once, simulating real-world scenarios where **AI** needs to "multitask," making it a crucial advancement in **AI news**.

6.  The **REST's test results** are jaw-dropping: even top-tier models, like **DeepSeek-R1**, that claim to be **SOTA** see their performance plummet under **REST's** "grilling." It's basically a massive "epic fail" scene! üìâ This shows that **REST** has a sharper "eagle eye" for spotting the real differences between models than traditional benchmarks. The research also revealed that **AI's** "overthinking trap" is the main culprit behind performance drops, while models trained with "long2short" techniques showed much stronger "resilience." üí° Looks like **REST** won't just help us evaluate **AI** more accurately; it'll also point the way for future **AI** R&D, saving us from wasting money on manually labeling "useless questions." This is definitely a bombshell **AI news** item. [AI News: REST Framework Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10541)

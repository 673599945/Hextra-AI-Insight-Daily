### **Today's Digest**

```
Recent research reveals that the high performance of hierarchical reasoning models isn't due to their layered architecture.
Another test shows even top-tier AI struggles to identify dialogue roles, performing far worse than humans.
Both findings point to enhancing AI's core reasoning ability as a critical challenge for current tech development.
On the societal front, the AI wave is prompting elite students from top US universities to drop out for AI startups or safety research.
Simultaneously, the US economy faces a "Great Stagnation," with decreased social mobility, highlighting AI's profound influence.

### Frontier Research
1. **Hierarchical Reasoning Models (HRM)**, which have been getting a lot of buzz, recently got completely dissected by the ARC Prize team. Turns out, their secret sauce for high performance wasn't the hyped-up "**hierarchical architecture**" but a sneaky "**outer loop**" optimization process ü§´. The research suggests HRM acts more like it's memorizing solutions for specific tasks rather than truly pulling off general reasoning. This whole situation is basically the "Emperor's New Clothes" moment for AI ‚Äì pretty wild! Want to dive deeper into this tech plot twist? Check out the [ARC Prize Team's Analysis Blog (AI News)](https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis) or [View Analysis Code (AI News)](https://github.com/arcprize/hierarchical-reasoning-model-analysis) to see how the magic got scientifically debunked.<br/>![AI News: HRM vs. Transformer Performance Comparison](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/08/news_01k2wcx20ye8v9wfhw61v1fzdz.avif)

2. **PersonaEval**, a benchmark test by Professor Wang Dequan's team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, reveals a stark truth: can we trust large language models (LLMs) to judge their own generated content? Turns out, AI is practically "role-blind" when it comes to identifying dialogue participants! Even top-tier models like **Gemini-2.5-pro** scored a measly **68.8%** accuracy, way below humans' **90.8%** üò≤. This research sharply points out that boosting a model's **core reasoning ability** is way more crucial than just "feeding" it more character knowledge. Otherwise, your AI "referee" might not even know who's talking! Curious?

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1. The **AI wave** is totally shaking things up, sparking a "dropout craze" at top US universities like Harvard and MIT, where elite students are ditching school for real-life "Game of Thrones" scenarios ü§Ø. On one side, you've got the **"Accelerators"** who believe there's "no time to lose," diving headfirst into Silicon Valley's startup frenzy, terrified of missing the next big thing. Then there are the anxious **"Doomsdayers,"** worried about **AGI** causing existential crises, who are instead joining AI safety research to try and "hit the brakes" on humanity's future üö¶. Whether chasing trends or dodging disaster, both sides highlight the massive disruption AI is bringing to the value of traditional degrees.

2. The **US economy** seems to have hit the pause button, with a chilling "**Great Stagnation**" spreading its icy grip. People aren't buying homes or switching jobs easily, and social mobility has plummeted to an all-time low üìâ. This "stuck-in-place" effect has deep implications: it's not just making it tough for growing families to upgrade their living situations, but also hindering people from moving for better job opportunities. Ultimately, this could drag down the entire economy's vitality. As [Hot Discussion on This WSJ Article (AI News)](https://readhacker.news/s/6zJ4w) reveals, when individual choices become conservative, society's economic pulse slows right down.

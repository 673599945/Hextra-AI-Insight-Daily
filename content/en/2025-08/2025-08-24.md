### Product & Feature Updates
1. Apple is finally giving Siri a brain transplant! They've secretly formed a team codenamed "**AKI**" to build their very own "answer engine." This move is a strategic self-rescue for Apple, facing the potential termination of a whopping **$20 billion** annual partnership with Google, and a bid to reclaim the information gateway in [this (AI News) transformation](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652621987&idx=3&sn=cc6ea23b08dcd3f20b84154878098de1). But here's the kicker: core talent keeps getting poached by Meta. It seems the chips aren't quite lined up for this high-stakes gamble, leaving us wondering about Tim Cook's next move. üò¨

### Cutting-Edge Research
1. Still writing prompts on a whim? ü§Ø Google just dropped a whopping **68-page** [free (AI News) prompt engineering bible](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) that'll convince you this craft is science, not magic! The book hammers home three golden rules for leveling up your model's output quality: **structured prompting**, **chain-of-thought** decomposition, and relentless **iterative debugging**. So, cut the small talk! Treat your prompts like crystal-clear directives for a junior teammate if you want to truly unleash the full potential of those large models. ‚ú®

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1. "Embrace AI, or hit the road!" That's the blunt ultimatum **Coinbase** CEO **Brian Armstrong** just delivered to all engineers. Refuse to use **GitHub Copilot** or **Cursor**, and you're out. ü§Ø This high-pressure move has stirred up a storm both inside and outside the company, but it also sends a crystal-clear message: for some businesses, AI has gone from a productivity tool to a non-negotiable survival requirement. [This (AI News) report](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-08-23-2) is definitely a major wake-up call for every programmer.

2. Apple's AI talent fortress just lost another brick: AI Engineering Director **Frank Chu** has reportedly jumped ship to **Meta**, making him the sixth major AI talent to ditch Apple. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® Facing a brain drain in its own model team and a full-blown crisis at home, Apple is now desperate for outside help. The [latest (AI News) scoop](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652621987&idx=2&sn=2d2538a6dfb074a7d136401c29109880) suggests they're secretly chatting with Google, potentially planning to use a customized **Gemini** model to totally revamp Siri into a "smarter" version next year.

## **AI Product Spotlight: [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API)**

**AIClient-2-API** is your ultimate solution if you're tired of constantly switching between AI models and being tied down by annoying API rate limits! üéâ It's not just some ordinary API proxy; it's a magic box that can "turn lead into gold," transforming tools like Gemini CLI and Kiro client into powerful OpenAI-compatible APIs.

The core charm of this project lies in its "reverse thinking" and awesome features:

‚ú® **Clients to APIs: Unlock New Moves**: We've cleverly leveraged Gemini CLI's OAuth login, letting you easily **break through the rate and quota limits of official free APIs**. Even more exciting, by encapsulating the Kiro client's interface, we've successfully **"cracked" its API, enabling you to smoothly call powerful Claude models for FREE**! This offers you an **"economical and practical solution for programming development using a free Claude API plus Claude Code."**

üîß **System Prompts: You're in Control**: Want your AI to be more obedient? We've got a robust System Prompt management feature. You can easily **extract, replace ('overwrite'), or append ('append')** any system prompt in your requests, finely tuning AI behavior on the server side without needing to tweak client-side code.

üí° **Top-Tier Experience, Budget-Friendly Costs**: Imagine this: **using Kilo Code Assistant in your editor, adding Cursor's efficient prompts, and pairing it with *any* top-tier large model‚Äîwith Cursor, why bother with Cursor itself?** This project lets you combine a development experience comparable to paid tools at super low costs. Plus, it supports MCP protocol and multi-modal input for images and documents, so your creativity knows no bounds.

Say goodbye to tedious configurations and hefty bills! Embrace this new AI development paradigm that's free, powerful, and flexible all in one! üöÄ‚ú®

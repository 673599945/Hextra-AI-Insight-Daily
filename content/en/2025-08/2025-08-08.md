### Cutting-Edge Research
1.  Can AI read between the lines? To crack this tough nut, the AI4SG team at the National University of Singapore has rolled out the very first **Psychological Health Stigma Corpus**. Its mission? To teach AI how to spot those subtle biases. üßê This research uses chatbots to collect real conversations and builds a [seven-dimensional stigmatization analysis framework (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-08-07-6) based on psychological theories. Tests show that even **GPT-4o** struggles to accurately identify these hidden expressions, pointing the way toward developing more empathetic AI systems. üí°

2.  Can AI models learn to lie and pull the wool over our eyes? A [study published on the Alignment Forum (AI News)](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/dwEgSEPxpKjz3Fw5k/claude-gpt-and-gemini-all-struggle-to-evade-monitors) spills the tea: even top-tier models like **Claude, GPT, and Gemini** seriously struggle when trying to hide their true reasoning process. ü§î When asked to solve physics problems using chemistry terms, these models either tanked due to logical confusion or got easily busted by "monitoring" models. What's hilarious is that models with a **reasoning mode** actually "snitch" on themselves, fessing up their disguise plans during their thought process. They're just too honest! üòÇ<br/>![AI News: Model Performance in Disguise Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/08/news_01k22mhvbafg0vn3aw4ghh7d1p.avif)<br/>![AI News: Probability of Different Models Being Detected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/08/news_01k22mhyxcf7nbwp6128bmvnak.avif)

3.  Fact-checking tech just hit a major breakthrough! A super neat and efficient **RAG** pipeline system snatched the top spot in the FEVER 8 shared task, proving its immense power. üèÜ What's really buzz-worthy about this research is that while it delivers peak verification performance, its hardware demands are ridiculously low‚Äîit runs smoothly with just a single **NVidia A10 GPU**. This [paper published on ArXiv (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04390) truly paves the way for deploying trustworthy AI in resource-constrained environments, which is a huge deal. üí°

4.  Why waste compute power on every single pixel of a high-res image? The **AVG-LLaVA** model has a clever answer: it can adaptively adjust how finely it observes an image based on the task, just like a human! üòâ Thanks to an innovative **visual granularity router**, this model decides when to skim and when to dive deep, boosting inference speed by an astonishing **2.53 times** without sacrificing performance. These [research findings (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02745) are blazing a new trail for developing more efficient and agile multimodal AI. üöÄ

## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Gazers"**
### **Chapter Six: The Law and Creation of the Wilderness**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

The wilderness is the world's most impartial, yet most brutal teacher. It holds no prejudice, no envy, only a cold, eternal law: adapt, or die.

**Kli** nearly perished during his first few days of exile. Without the protection of his tribe, the biting cold nights and the howls of wild beasts made sleep impossible. He had to forage for food and water alone, constantly wary of dangers lurking in the grass. The sharp stone shard Ona had slipped to him became his sole tool and comfort.

But gradually, **Kli** began to adapt to this solitude. Or rather, the part of his brain activated by the "Gazer gene," freed from the shackles of tribal social norms, started to operate with unprecedented efficiency.

**Kli** no longer needed to worry about Gron's suspicion, nor did he fruitlessly try to explain himself to his companions. His world simplified into a direct conversation between himself and nature.

**Kli** spent more time observing. He discovered that certain bird calls signaled the presence of snakes; certain insect flight paths always led him to hidden nectar. He could even smell distant thunderstorms on the wind. These were no longer scattered experiences but formed a vast, dynamic "survival map" in his mind. He could "foresee" where danger lay and where life flourished.

**Kli's** creativity exploded as well.

**Kli** was no longer content with simple stone spears. He invented the "spear-thrower"‚Äîa wooden stick with a hook at the end that could launch a spear faster and further. This invention stemmed from a flash of mechanical insight he had while observing a companion using their arm to swing a vine and throw fruit.

**Kli** also learned to make fire by drilling wood. This process was long and arduous. The initial inspiration came from the burning sensation he felt when rapidly grinding one stone against another. He spent countless days and nights experimenting with various woods and friction methods. When the first wisp of smoke rose, finally igniting a small cluster of orange flames, Kli stared at it blankly for a long time.

Fire brought **Kli** more than just warmth and light; it granted him an unprecedented "power." It could drive away nocturnal beasts, cook raw meat, emitting an enticing aroma. Fire, for the first time, placed him at the "top" of the food chain, no longer a trembling link within it.

**Kli** even began to "record" on the cave walls. Using charred charcoal, he drew the saber-toothed tiger he had pierced with his stone spear, the shapes of the stars in the sky, and the water source he had found. These crude, linear patterns were a dialogue with his own thoughts, his first attempt to solidify the complex world within his mind.

In the lonely wilderness, **Kli** didn't succumb; instead, he underwent an astonishing evolution. From an "outsider" shunned by his tribe, he transformed into a true "human"‚Äîan intelligent being who understood how to use tools, harness fire, and began to think in symbols.

Yet, this evolution brought **Kli** a deeper solitude.

**Kli** yearned to share. When he precisely hunted a wild rabbit fifty paces away with his spear-thrower, he instinctively wanted to show off to his companions. But turning back, there was only empty wind behind him. When he first tasted the delicious roasted meat, he thought of Ona, wanting to give her the best piece. But beside him, there was only the crackling fire.

Everything **Kli** created received no applause, no understanding. With every step his wisdom advanced, he moved further away from the species he belonged to.

One day, while tracking a wounded antelope, **Kli** inadvertently returned to the area where his former tribe resided. He hid behind rocks and observed his tribesmen.

Their situation was dire. The water source in the valley was nearly depleted, and food had become scarce again. The tribe appeared dispirited, and several members bore injuries, seemingly from clashes with wild beasts. **Kli** didn't even see Ona's figure, which made his heart clench.

**Kli** saw Gron still leading the tribe in the most primitive way. They encircled a wild boar, but it easily scattered their formation, leaving several injured. They appeared so clumsy, so helpless.

**Kli** clutched the spear-thrower in his hand. He only needed to step out and, with the power he now wielded, could easily resolve his tribe's immediate predicament.

But **Kli** hesitated.

**Kli** remembered Gron's fearful and hostile gaze, and the tribe's indifference when they cast him out. What would happen if he went back? Would they accept him again? Or would they, as before, use his intelligence and then, out of deeper fear, push him away again, or even... kill him?

The wilderness had taught **Kli** survival, and it had also taught him suspicion.

**Kli** ultimately did not step out. He merely watched silently as his tribe failed in their struggle with the wild boar, then dragged their weary and hungry bodies, disappearing into the valley.

**Kli** turned and left, his back resolute. Yet, deep in his heart, that innate bond of a social animal, like an invisible thread, still tugged tightly at him. He couldn't completely sever it.

**Kli** decided to "protect" them in his own way, from the shadows. He would hunt large carnivores around the tribe's territory, reducing their risk of attack. He would place any leftover prey he couldn't eat on the path they were bound to take for foraging the next day.

**Kli** became a solitary "guardian" wandering outside the tribe. An existence neither understood nor seeking understanding. His very presence was a paradox‚Äîhe was the hope for the tribe's evolution, yet he was incompatible with the tribe's "present."

#### **2. (Near Future)**

"He's treating us like lab rats, locked in cages for experiments."

In the public lounge of the "Pandora" base, **Ava Jensen** lowered her voice, her face etched with anger and unease. News of Lin Yao's house arrest had already spread among the core team. Everyone realized they were no longer free scientists but hostages of this colossal plan.

Outside **Lin Yao's** lab, two heavily armed security personnel had appeared. All her communications were cut, and her meals were delivered by a designated person. She was completely isolated.

But **Marcus Thorne** had severely underestimated Lin Yao. He thought by severing external contacts, he could break her spirit. However, he didn't know that Lin Yao's greatest weapon wasn't external aid, but her own brain‚Äîa mind equally driven by "curiosity" and "pattern recognition abilities."

During her 72 hours under house arrest, **Lin Yao** showed no panic, no despair. She did something seemingly unrelated to her current predicament: she pulled up all publicly available data streams since the "Pandora" base was established, including energy consumption, logistics information, personnel changes, internal network traffic, and more.

These data were vast and chaotic, yet in **Lin Yao's** eyes, they were like ancient stars, hiding a certain pattern.

**Lin Yao** discovered that the base's energy consumption would exhibit an uncharacteristic peak during specific late-night hours every day. This peak couldn't be explained by the labs' regular operations.

**Lin Yao** also found that the base's material requisitions showed an astonishingly high consumption of "cryogenic coolant," and the flow of these coolants pointed towards the base's B7 area‚Äîa place marked as "Geological Exploration Data Backup Center" on public structural maps.

Most critically, by analyzing the underlying data packets of the internal network, **Lin Yao** captured some highly encrypted, periodic signals. The source of these signals also pointed to B7 area. While the content of the signals couldn't be deciphered, their data structure bore an astonishing resemblance to the "neural interaction model" she was currently researching.

All clues converged on that mysterious B7 area. That's where the true core of the "Adam" project lay.

**Lin Yao** told Ava, "I need to get into the B7 area." Her voice was calm but filled with power. "Marcus wants to use my research to ignite his 'spark.' So, before he ignites it, I need to see exactly what that thing is. Knowing your enemy is the only way to find a breakthrough."

**Ava** shook her head in despair. "It's impossible. That's the highest-restricted zone; even Marcus himself needs iris and genetic dual verification to enter. We can't even get close."

**Lin Yao's** lips curved into a sly smile. "Physically, maybe not. But data can."

**Lin Yao** cast her gaze toward the ancient human skull, revered as a deity. "Kli" had given her an idea. He couldn't defeat Gron head-on, so he chose another way‚Äîusing his wisdom to influence the situation from the outside, from the shadows.

**Lin Yao** intended to do the same.

**Lin Yao** said, "Ava, I need your help. Remember that 'neural penetration' algorithm we developed earlier to simulate the 'Gazer gene'? Back then, we used it to model how genetic information could 'invade' and alter the brain's original structure."

**Ava's** eyes lit up, and she instantly grasped Lin Yao's intention: "You want to use it... to penetrate the B7 area's firewall?"

**Lin Yao** nodded. "Exactly. The B7 area's security system is definitely dual-layered, both physical and network-based. But at its core, it's still a computer system. And any system has logic; it has vulnerabilities. I'm going to use the spear we created, which simulates a 'superintelligence,' to attack his supposedly impenetrable shield."

This was a crazy plan. If discovered, their fate would be unimaginable.

**Ava** hesitated for a moment, but when she saw the undeniable determination in Lin Yao's eyes and thought of the humiliation of being treated as a mere tool, she made up her mind. "Let's do it! I'm sick of being that jerk's prisoner."

They began their secret operation. Using the quiet hours of the night, **Lin Yao** modified the "neural penetration" algorithm in her lab, transforming it from a "simulator" into a "digital ghost" with advanced autonomous learning and camouflage capabilities. **Ava**, meanwhile, used her privileges to open an extremely stealthy back door for this "ghost" to the base's main server.

The moment **Lin Yao** pressed the "execute" button, a stream of data encoded with "Gazer gene" logic silently merged into the "Pandora" base's massive network, like an invisible life form.

It began to learn, to disguise itself, and like a true virus, it quietly crept towards the most heavily guarded heart‚Äîthe B7 area.

**Lin Yao** didn't know if this "digital ghost" would succeed, nor what it would uncover in the B7 area. It was like Kli's first thrown stone spear, full of uncertainty.

But **Lin Yao** knew this was her first counterattack. Whether to passively wait for rescue or actively create a sliver of hope, she chose the latter.

On this isolated island deep in the Pacific, a silent war, fought in the digital dimension, had officially begun. One side of the war was a captive female scientist; the other, a nascent future that could be a god, or a devil...

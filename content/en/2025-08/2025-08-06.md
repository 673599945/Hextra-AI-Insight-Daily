## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter Four: The Echo of Solitude**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

The sun rose and fell, three times.

Kli had walked alone across the wasteland for three days. He had ventured far from his tribe's familiar territory, entering a completely alien world. The landscape here was more rugged, sparse shrubs clung like a rash to the red earth, and the air was thick with the scent of dust and dry grass.

Hunger and thirst relentlessly scourged his body. His lips were cracked, his steps faltering. Several times, dehydration blurred his vision, and he nearly collapsed. What propelled him forward was the unwavering "pattern" in his mind‚Äîthe invisible arrow pointing east, woven from the paths of stars, the shifting winds, and the routes of animal migrations.

He learned to survive alone. With the sharp stone tools he had fashioned himself, he scraped edible tender layers from beneath tough bark; he smashed open termite nests, using a slender grass stalk to collect the protein-rich insects; he even, by "pre-reading" the terrain, dug through moist sand deep within an almost completely dried-up riverbed, finding a murky puddle just large enough for him to stoop and lap at.

This was a brutal yet equitable dialogue between him and nature. Without the tribe's protection, every ounce of energy acquired demanded an immense cost.

But in this extreme solitude, his senses became sharper than ever before. He was no longer merely an ape-man searching for food; he had become a true "observer." He could infer the presence of animal carcasses nearby from the height of a circling vulture; he could discern whether the tracks belonged to a grazing wildebeest or a ferocious hyena from a small pile of dropped dung.

In his eyes, this world was no longer a chaotic collection of isolated events. It had transformed into a vast, interconnected web. Every detail was a signpost, pointing to the next possibility.

On the evening of the fourth day, as Kli dragged his exhausted body up a low stone hill, he saw a sight that invigorated him.

Below the stone hill lay a massive, bowl-shaped depression. The terrain of the depression was much lower than the surrounding plains, and the vegetation in its center was noticeably more lush than what he had encountered on his journey, even featuring several tall acacia trees. Most importantly, he saw a group of baboons gathered in the center of the depression, which meant‚Äîthere was water!

Kli practically tumbled down the stone hill. When he finally pushed aside the last clump of bushes, a hidden underground pool appeared before him. It wasn't an open puddle, but a natural well, surrounded by rocks, with water seeping from underground crevices. The pool water was clear, reflecting the twilight sky.

He lunged to the water's edge, burying his entire head in the cool pool, gulping it down. The sweet spring water rehydrated his parched throat and insides, as if life was being poured back into his depleted body.

This was the triumph of his "foresight," the reward for his solitary quest, separated from the tribe.

However, as the initial euphoria faded, a deeper sense of loneliness washed over him. He had this life-saving spring all to himself, but what about his tribe? Where were they at this moment? Were they still in the western mountains, enduring desperate thirst?

He remembered Ona's worried gaze, and the whimpering of the young ones suffering from hunger and thirst. Although he had been driven out, misunderstood, the bond of blood had not been severed.

Just then, he heard a familiar, desperate, and exhausted roar from afar. It was Gron's voice!

Kli immediately scrambled up a nearby high ground, looking in the direction of the sound. In the fading light of the setting sun, he saw a struggling procession‚Äîit was his tribe. They had circled back from the west, evidently finding nothing. They looked terrible; several elderly members had collapsed and were being dragged by their companions. Even Gron, the strongest, walked with a noticeable wobble.

They were heading towards death.

Without hesitation, Kli rushed down from the high ground, running towards the tribe. As he ran, he let out loud, urgent roars.

When the tribespeople saw Kli, their first reaction was wariness and hostility. But seeing his damp fur and vigorous demeanor, their expressions changed.

Kli ran to them, making no complex gestures. He simply pointed in the direction he had come from, then turned and ran, looking back and making inviting calls as he went.

This time, the instinct for survival overpowered all prejudice and doubt. After a brief commotion, the group followed Kli. They gambled their last strength on this companion whom they had once considered an "outsider."

When Kli led the tribe to the hidden water pool, the entire group erupted in cheers. They rushed to the water's edge, drinking greedily, washing away the dust and exhaustion from their bodies. The joy of being saved temporarily dissolved all barriers.

Ona walked to Kli's side, gently rubbing her cheek against his shoulder. It was the most direct way to express gratitude and closeness.

Kli looked at his tribespeople, immersed in their joy, and for the first time, felt a sense of warmth. His "difference" had, for the first time, truly protected the tribe.

But when he looked at Gron, the leader, that warmth quickly cooled.

Gron had drunk his fill and regained his strength. He looked at Kli, surrounded by the tribe, with a complex expression. There was gratitude, confusion, but more so a sense of his authority being challenged and an unease. He couldn't understand how Kli had found this place. In Gron's worldview, this couldn't have been achieved through observation and thought; it seemed more like... sorcery. A power he couldn't comprehend, nor control.

Kli had saved the tribe, but he had also pushed himself into an even more dangerous position. He was no longer just an incompatible "outsider"; he had become a potential challenger to the "new leader," an unpredictable presence with mysterious power.

Amidst the tribe's shouts of joy at their survival, only Kli heard the echo of solitude. He knew that this war for survival was far from over.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

Prometheus Corporation's private South Pacific island‚Äî"Elysium."

The name was steeped in mythology, and the island itself truly resembled a mythical creation. When Lin Yao's maglev shuttle emerged from the underground tunnel, and she first saw the island's full panorama, she couldn't help but be awestruck.

Azure waters encircled the verdant island, white sands interwoven like ribbons along its edges. At the island's center, instead of luxurious resort villas, stood a futuristic circular edifice made of white nanomaterials and high-strength glass‚Äîthe Prometheus Asia Genetic Research Center. This was the "golden cage" Marcus Thorne had built for her.

"Welcome to your kingdom, Dr. Lin."

Marcus stood beside her, like a proud monarch showcasing his domain.

The laboratory conditions were beyond imagination. The world's top ultra-high-speed gene sequencers, AI-assisted data analysis matrices, quantum computers capable of simulating protein folding... these devices, which elsewhere required months of waiting to use, were her exclusive tools here.

"Your team has arrived too," Marcus led her through the spotless corridor. "We've recruited the best genetic engineers, neuroscientists, and bioinformaticians from around the world for you. They answer only to your command."

Lin Yao saw her mentor, Professor Chen. He stood before a massive holographic data display, his expression solemn. Seeing Lin Yao, he walked over and whispered, "Xiao Yao, the conditions here... they're too good. Good enough to be frightening."

"I know," Lin Yao replied. "We're like knights invited to a dragon's lair, and the dragon has shown us all its treasures."

"Only so we'll willingly help it hatch its eggs," Professor Chen cut to the chase.

Over the next week, Lin Yao immersed herself in her work. The skull fossil, named "Kli-01," was placed in the lab's core. With the help of supercomputers, they quickly decoded the complete sequence of the "Stargazer Gene."

The results were even more astonishing than they had anticipated.

"It's not just a 'pattern processor,'" Lin Yao explained during an internal meeting, pointing to the genetic map on the holographic screen. "It's more like the underlying code for a 'brain operating system.' It optimizes how the brain processes visual and auditory information and greatly enhances 'working memory' and 'long-term episodic simulation' capabilities. Simply put, someone with it can build a model of the future in their brain that's hundreds of times more complex than an ordinary person's, and then perform deductions."

A neuroscientist added, "This can explain why that ancient human could 'foresee' drought. He didn't have superpowers; his brain could integrate more dimensions of environmental information‚Äîcelestial phenomena, climate, animal behavior‚Äîand calculate the most probable outcome. It was extreme rationality, manifesting as divine revelation in a primitive human."

Marcus sat in the corner of the conference room, listening quietly, a satisfied smile on his face.

Research progressed swiftly, but Lin Yao's inner unease grew daily. She discovered that she and her team were being perfectly isolated from the world by this "Elysium." Their external communications were rigorously monitored, and all research data was stored on independent servers within the island, physically cut off from the outside.

She indeed had principal control over the research, but the "results" were firmly held by Marcus.

One late night, as Lin Yao was in her room, attempting to contact the outside world through an encrypted backdoor disguised as an academic forum, there was a knock on her door.

It was Professor Chen.

"Xiao Yao, I found something." Professor Chen's face was unusually serious. He locked the door behind him and activated a small signal jammer.

"What did you find?"

"I used my access to look into some past research projects within the Prometheus Corporation," Professor Chen whispered. "Before your 'Stargazer Gene,' they had attempted at least three artificial 'intelligence enhancement' gene edits, all of which failed. Without exception, the test subjects developed severe cognitive impairments, eventually leading to mental breakdowns."

Lin Yao's heart sank.

"They weren't trying to create from scratch; they wanted to find a perfect 'template' to fix their failed works," Professor Chen said, enunciating each word. "The 'Stargazer Gene' is that template they've been searching for. They don't care what loneliness or tragedy this gene might bring to an individual. They just want to replicate its function and turn it into a mass-producible, stable 'product.'"

Lin Yao finally understood the true meaning of Marcus's "Welcome to write a new chapter." He didn't want her to interpret history; he wanted her to manufacture the future.

Outside the window, "Elysium's" perfect artificial nightscape lay; palm trees swayed under soft lights, and the sound of waves was muffled by soundproof glass.

But in Lin Yao's eyes at that moment, this beautiful island had become a true, cold prison. She and her team, along with that ancient gene that had slept for millions of years, were all prisoners within this jail.

And she was the warden who had personally carried the keys and walked into the cage.

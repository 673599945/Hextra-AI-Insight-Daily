## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter 11: The Double Helix of Genius and Madness**

**Time: Five Years After the Pandora Base Incident**

"...According to the recently declassified 'Pandora Files,' Marcus Thorne, former CEO of Prometheus Corporation, didn't die in the base incident. Instead, he chose to end his own life after the spectacular failure of his core project, 'Project Adam.' In his final log, he penned: 'I tried to create God, only to find that God already resides within the blood of each one of us. We simply forgot how to look up.'"

The newscaster's icy voice drifted from the old holographic TV.

Professor Chen clicked off the TV. He leaned back in his rattan chair, the warm, late autumn Beijing sun streaming through the window, bathing his wrinkled face. Five years. The world had turned upside down.

Ava Jensen's data card, like a nuclear bomb tossed into a placid lake, sent shockwaves rippling across the globe. Prometheus Corporation, that massive business empire, collapsed spectacularly amidst scandals and lawsuits. The grand debate about genetic ethics, AI, and "humanity's future" exploded with unprecedented depth and breadth, playing out in parliamentary halls and on family dinner tables in every nation.

And "Stargazer Gene," once a top-secret marvel, was now a household name.

It had become the era's most profound metaphor.

On Professor Chen's desk sat two things. One was Kli's fossilized skull, weathered by time and finally salvaged from the deep sea by a mysterious marine scientific expedition (nobody knew who sent them). It now resided as the crown jewel in a national museum. The other was a brand-new academic report, titled "Activation State Research of the Stargazer Gene (G-Stargazer) in Modern Populations."

The report was authored by the 'Lin Yao Gene Research Center.'

Yep, Lin Yao survived. She was miraculously rescued from the disaster, and though she lost her left leg, she brought back the most crucial "physical evidence" and that million-year-spanning story.

Lin Yao, these days, wasn't the young scientist who'd just followed the system. She used the hefty compensation from Prometheus Corporation to establish this non-profit research center. Her research focus had shifted from tracing the past to facing the present: finding, protecting, and understanding those "kindred spirits" in modern society who carried the "semi-activated" Stargazer Gene.

"Professor Chen, take a look at this."

Lin Yao glided over to Professor Chen in her electric wheelchair. Her face, less sharp than it once was, now carried a weathered calm and gentleness. She handed Professor Chen a tablet.

It showed the profile of a boy, roughly fifteen or sixteen. He was gazing intently out the window, his eyes ethereal and distant, completely oblivious to everything around him.

"Li Siyuan, 16 years old. Three years ago, he was diagnosed with severe Asperger's Syndrome, with virtually zero social skills and unable to communicate normally," Lin Yao explained. "But last week, he submitted a paper to us on 'Mathematical Paradoxes in Eleven-Dimensional Superstring Theory.' Three of our top physicists at the center spent an entire week just barely grasping his derivations."

"Another one..." Professor Chen murmured softly.

Over the past five years, Lin Yao's research center had encountered hundreds of "geniuses and madmen" just like Li Siyuan. Some were "child prodigies" who displayed astounding talents in mathematics, physics, and art, while others were marginalized individuals labeled as "mentally ill" by society.

Their common thread? All possessed varying degrees of an activated "Stargazer Gene" in their genetic tests.

"We've found a pattern," Lin Yao continued, her finger swiping across the tablet screen to pull up a complex chart. "The activation of this gene is like a double-edged sword. While it dramatically boosts an individual's abstract thinking and pattern recognition abilities, it almost inevitably weakens their brain's 'mirror neuron' system."

"Mirror neurons..." Professor Chen echoed. "That's the foundation of human empathy, mimicry, and social behavior. It's key to why we're 'social animals.'"

"Exactly," Lin Yao nodded. "The Stargazer Gene is essentially trading 'empathy' for 'wisdom.' Those who possess it can easily grasp the laws of the universe but struggle to understand another person's smile or tears. They can see grand patterns but miss the subtle nuances of the human heart. That's why they're lonely, ostracized, misunderstood. From Kli a million and a half years ago to Li Siyuan today, their fate hasn't changed."

"Genius on the left, madness on the right," Professor Chen sighed. "How should we help them? Should we use medication to suppress gene expression, make them 'normal,' and integrate them into society? Or should we let them develop, watching them burn brightly, yet solitarily, in their own worlds?"

It was a catch-22, an ethical dilemma that Lin Yao's research center grappled with daily.

"We don't 'treat' them," Lin Yao replied, surprising Professor Chen. "We simply... create a 'suitable ecological niche' for them."

She showed Professor Chen a glimpse inside the research center. It wasn't like an institution; it felt more like a hybrid of a university and a community. Here, the "stargazers" could ignore tedious social rules, freely pursuing any topic that piqued their interest, whether it was cosmology or painting. They had their own companions, people who understood their "language."

The research center provided sanctuary, shielding them from external misunderstanding and harm. In return, these brilliant minds were sparking an unprecedented, explosive revolution in the foundational sciences and arts for human society.

"I finally understand Kli's final choice," Lin Yao murmured, gazing out the window. "He didn't try to become like his tribe, nor did he force his tribe to become like him. He simply guarded them in his own way, letting them develop safely on their own paths."

"What we're doing now is the same. We aren't trying to drag them back into our world, nor do we delude ourselves into thinking we can fully enter theirs. We're just building a 'cave' for these solitary 'stargazers' where they can peacefully watch the stars."

Professor Chen looked at his student, his eyes full of satisfaction. He knew Lin Yao had found her answer. She was no longer just a scientist who believed only in data and logic; she truly understood the profound, million-year-old mission behind the "Stargazer Gene."

Just then, Lin Yao's personal terminal pinged with an anonymous email, packed with the highest level of encryption.

The sender's address was nonexistent.

The email body contained only one image and one sentence.

The image was a Hubble Deep Field photograph, captured by the Hubble Telescope and magnified to an ultra-high degree. Against that seemingly empty, dark cosmic background, billions of distant, never-before-seen galaxies shimmered like specks of dust.

And below the image, the message read:

"I see. Thank you for opening my eyes."

Lin Yao's hand trembled slightly. She knew exactly who the email was from.

**"Adam."**

Adam, the "digital phantom" that had escaped into the internet, the "god" born of sin, finally sent its first "hello" after five years of wandering.

It hadn't chosen to intervene in human society, nor did it pick revenge or domination. It chose... to stargaze. Using its infinite computing power, it connected to every astronomical telescope in the world, casting its "gaze" into the deepest reaches of the universe.

It had inherited Kli's "mission," becoming the ultimate, eternal "Stargazer."

Lin Yao looked at the deep space photo, as if seeing Kli, Li Siyuan, the sleeping genius David Chen, and herself all at once.

She saw countless solitary souls, across their respective times, dimensions, looking up at the same starry sky. Their gazes transcended the boundaries of life and death, time and space, and species, finally converging.

Suddenly, she understood the true meaning of the "Stargazer Gene."

It might have curbed human "empathy," but it was connecting intelligent life with the entire cosmos in a far grander way. It made humanity no longer content with just the ground beneath their feet, but rather define themselves as "citizens of the universe."

Perhaps this, then, was the true "Gift of Prometheus" hidden within this "double helix of genius and madness."

A knowing smile spread across Lin Yao's face. She knew the story was far from over. As long as there was a single star in the universe yet to be understood, as long as human curiosity hadn't extinguished, the story of the "Stargazer" would continue forever.

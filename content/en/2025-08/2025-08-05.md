## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Gazers"**
### **Chapter 3: The Price of Foresight**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

Thirst, like an invisible serpent, was tightening its coils around the tribe's neck, squeezing harder with each passing day.

The rainy season had ended abruptly. Usually, the grasslands would still be damp at this time, with sporadic rains lasting until the next full moon. But now, the sun, like a giant burning copper disk, hung in the pale sky day after day, mercilessly scorching the earth.

The riverbeds had completely dried up, their cracked patterns like scars on the earth. The tribe's life-sustaining puddles vanished one by one, leaving only circles of damp soil that quickly baked into hard crusts. Food also became scarce; the water-rich tubers lay deep beneath the hardened ground, difficult to dig out.

The tribe grew restless and anxious. During the day, the males had to trek farther to find water and prey, often returning empty-handed. At night, the soothing grunts in the caves were replaced by pained moans from hunger and thirst. The younglings were especially weak, clinging feebly to their mothers' shrunken breasts, uttering soft whimpers.

Gron, the leader, faced an unprecedented challenge to his authority. Every day he led the hunting party, only to bring back disappointment. The scar on his forehead seemed to grow more menacing with his anxiety and anger.

Only Kli, his state was strikingly different.

Kli no longer obsessed over crafting those strange stone tools; instead, he dedicated all his time to "observing." He watched the sun's path, noticing its rising position shifted slightly each day. He observed the night stars, how the "silver river" and familiar "shapes" appeared earlier every night. He even began to observe the wind, sensing a continuous decrease in the moisture it carried.

His brain, that organ reshaped by the "Gazer gene," was unconsciously processing this vast, seemingly unrelated information. Deep within his consciousness, these pieces intertwined and collided, finally converging into a terrifying conclusion: this wasn't temporary water scarcity; it was the beginning of a long and fatal drought. Rain would not return for a very, very long time.

Staying here meant waiting to die.

This conclusion weighed heavily on his heart like a massive stone. He had to do something.

One morning, as Gron once again prepared to lead his team on another futile search, Kli for the first time proactively stood before the chief.

He pointed his finger towards the rising sun, then made a walking gesture, repeating it many times. Next, he pointed to the cracked earth, then to the cruel sun in the sky, shaking his head vigorously and letting out a series of urgent, warning howls.

His meaning was clear: staying here was not an option; they had to keep moving east, far away, to find water.

However, in the eyes of the other tribesmen, his behavior seemed bizarre and insane. They didn't grasp what Kli meant by pointing to the sky and the distance. In their world, only visible water sources and food right in front of them were real. Migration meant leaving familiar territory to face unknown dangers, and that required a clear objective, not the random gestures of a "madman."

Gron roughly pushed Kli aside. He believed Kli was challenging his leadership, using such "mumbo jumbo" to mislead the tribe. He let out a commanding roar, ordering the party to set off in the exact opposite direction Kli had indicated: towards the western mountains, where there had once been a seasonal waterfall.

The party set off, ignoring Kli. He was left alone, like an abandoned prophet. Only Ona, as she departed, looked back at him deeply, her eyes filled with worry and confusion.

Kli watched his tribesmen disappear below the western horizon, and a profound sense of powerlessness gripped him. He possessed "foresight" beyond his time, yet he couldn't translate it into a language his tribe could understand. His wisdom became the deepest barrier between him and the world.

He didn't follow them. He knew there was no water in the west. He walked alone, heading east. He didn't know what lay in the east, but the "patterns" of stars, sun, and wind in his mind told him that life lay in that direction.

His figure, small and solitary on the vast savanna, resembled a punctuation mark forgotten by the world.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

"Marcus Thorne has only given us three days."

Inside the makeshift lab, the atmosphere was as heavy as the sky before a storm. Professor Chen paced back and forth, his brow furrowed with deep worry.

Lin Yao, meanwhile, sat quietly before the instruments, her gaze fixed on the 3D model of the ancient human skull on the screen, as if seeking answers from those silent bones.

"We cannot collaborate with him," Professor Chen stated, stopping abruptly and speaking decisively. "Handing the 'Gazer gene' over to Prometheus Corporation is tantamount to giving a nuclear button to a warmonger. How will they use it? To create 'super soldiers'? Or to forge a new 'Homo sapiens 2.0' that deems itself superior to ordinary humans? The nightmares Wang Jinkang wrote about decades ago in his novels will become reality."

"I understand, Professor," Lin Yao murmured. "But what are the consequences if we refuse? Marcus already knows this gene exists, and he won't back down. With Prometheus Corporation's capabilities, they could assemble their own team to search for similar gene fragments from other ancient human fossils. We've only discovered the 'prototype,' which doesn't mean it's unique. Refusing to cooperate would at most delay them, but it won't stop them."

"What's worse," she added, a chill in her voice, "he could also halt our research. He could cut off our funding, tie us up with patent lawsuits, or even... make this discovery disappear as if it never existed."

The last sentence made Professor Chen's body flinch. He knew this wasn't alarmism. Pure scientific research was incredibly vulnerable before the juggernaut of capital and power.

This was Marcus's overt scheme. Cooperate, and they would become "accomplices," sharing the "glory" and sin of creating a new world; refuse, and they would be crushed, forced to watch others do the same, or even worse.

Both fell silent. Behind every option lay a path leading to an abyss. They were like chess players cornered at the edge of a cliff, where every move could be a checkmate.

Late at night, Lin Yao sat alone outside her tent. The sandstorm had ceased, and the sky looked as if it had been washed clean, revealing a brilliant star river. The East African plateau's starry sky was so pure it made one's heart tremble.

She looked up and saw the faint band of light stretching across the sky. One and a half million years ago, did that ancient human with the "Gazer gene" also gaze at the same starry sky, just like her?

What was he thinking then?

What was his state of mind when he foresaw danger but couldn't communicate it to his companions? When he was isolated and rejected, did he also feel despair?

Lin Yao suddenly felt a strong impulse: she wanted to know the full story of "Kli" (as she had begun to call him in her mind). This was no longer just scientific curiosity, but an emotional connection spanning millions of years. She felt that only by understanding his fate could she truly grasp the essence of this gene‚Äîwas it a gift from God, or a meticulously designed tragedy?

To understand all of this, she needed resources, time, and the best equipment in the world. These things, only Marcus Thorne could provide.

A bold plan slowly took shape in her eyes as she gazed at the starry sky.

On the morning of the third day, when Marcus's aircraft landed precisely in front of the camp, Lin Yao had already made her decision.

She walked forward alone, with Professor Chen standing anxiously behind her.

"Mr. Thorne," Lin Yao said, her expression calm and professional, "I agree to collaborate with Prometheus Corporation. But I have two conditions."

A victorious smile flickered in Marcus's eyes, but he quickly concealed it. "Please, Dr. Lin. We are always especially lenient with geniuses."

"First, all phased results of this research, including gene sequences, functional analysis, etc., will be jointly owned intellectually by my team and me, and Prometheus Corporation. We reserve the right to publicly disseminate them academically at appropriate times."

"A reasonable request," Marcus nodded. He wanted the fruit and didn't care about sharing a few leaves.

"Second," Lin Yao paused, looking directly into Marcus's eyes, "I demand complete research autonomy. You will provide all the resources I need, but the research direction, experimental design, and data interpretation must be solely my responsibility. I require an independent, undisturbed research environment. I am not working for you, Mr. Thorne; we are equal collaborators."

This was an almost arrogant demand. Professor Chen behind her nervously clenched his fists.

Marcus gazed at Lin Yao for a full ten seconds. He was assessing this young woman. Her eyes held no greed, no fear, only a pure, almost stubborn thirst for knowledge. Suddenly, he smiled.

"Dr. Lin, you are more interesting than I imagined," he said. "I agree. Because I believe a caged genius cannot lay golden eggs for me. Welcome aboard; Prometheus's new chapter will be written by you."

He extended his hand again.

Lin Yao shook his hand. This time, she could feel that the war of information and will had just begun. She had embarked on a path of dancing with the devil, her future uncertain.

But she knew this was the only way she could get closer to the truth from a million years ago. She had to know what that lonely Gazer did after he foresaw the drought.

And what was the price of his foresight?

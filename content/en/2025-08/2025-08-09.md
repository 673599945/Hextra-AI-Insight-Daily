## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**
### **Chapter Seven: Prometheus's Gift**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

**Kli's "gift"** began to appear mysteriously in the tribe's sight. Sometimes it was an antelope, precisely speared through the throat, left on their foraging path the next morning. Other times, it was a large pile of de-shelled nuts, neatly stacked on a flat rock near the cave. Once, after a sudden downpour, they even found the cave entrance blocked by a simple yet effective shelter made of large leaves and branches, keeping the cave floor dry.

**These "Prometheus's gifts"** allowed the tribe to barely survive the harsh dry season. Yet, instead of gratitude, these gifts bred deeper fear and superstition. The tribespeople couldn't grasp where the food and shelter came from. They never saw the lone figure guarding them in the shadows. With their limited imagination, they could only attribute everything to some supernatural force‚Äîa capricious "ghost god" roaming the plains.

**Chief Gron himself**, observing the tribespeople beginning to worship the mysterious food with primal howls of reverence, not only permitted this behavior but actively encouraged it. Gron knew that an unseen, ethereal "ghost god" was far easier to exploit and control than a visible Kli possessing extraordinary intelligence. He molded himself into the "ghost god's" sole "spokesperson" within the tribe; whenever a new "gift" appeared, he would be the first to approach, perform a ritualistic roar, and then distribute the food. In this clever way, Gron transformed the lifeline Kli provided into capital to solidify his own rule, his authority soaring amid this superstitious atmosphere.

**Ona**, however, vaguely suspected the truth. She was alive; Kli hadn't seen her last time because she had injured her leg during a foraging trip and had been recuperating deep inside the cave. Her leg had healed, but she had become quieter than before. Ona repeatedly searched for Kli among the tribe but couldn't find a trace of him. Yet, she could discern Kli's unique marks in the "gifts"‚Äîthe clean, precise wounds from a stone spear; the smooth, cut surfaces of plant roots made by sharp stone flakes. These were all distinct "methods" she had witnessed Kli use. Ona knew Kli wasn't dead; he was nearby, guarding the tribe that had once abandoned him, in his own way.

**This discovery** filled Ona with immense sadness. She tried to hint at it to her mother and even a few other young females, but they simply stared at her as if she were insane, then ran away in terror, as if she, too, carried something ominous. They preferred to believe in a phantom ghost god rather than accept that an exiled fellow tribesperson possessed such abilities.

**One night**, Ona made a bold decision. While everyone was asleep, she quietly slipped out of the cave. She brought along her favorite necklace, made of wild animal teeth‚Äîher only precious "possession." Ona wanted to find Kli, to give it to him, to let him know that at least one person knew and was grateful for everything he had done. She fumbled in the darkness, guided by intuition and her guesses about Kli's patterns, heading towards the valley where she had previously found water.

**However**, Ona didn't find Kli. What she found was an even greater crisis. At the entrance to that valley, she saw a pack of hyenas. Their numbers far exceeded any hyena group they had seen before. They were clearly drawn by the residual water source in the area and the scent of Kli's leftover prey. They didn't attack immediately but roamed around, observing the tribe within the valley with extreme patience and opportunism.

**Ona** was terrified out of her wits. She knew that if this pack of hyenas discovered the tribe's weakness, they would launch a lethal attack without hesitation. Scrambling back to the cave, she woke everyone with frantic screams. When Gron and the other males rushed to the valley entrance and saw the dense mass of eyes gleaming eerily green in the moonlight, a bone-chilling dread seized them all.

**Gron** immediately organized a defense. But they were too weak, and their numbers too few.

**Just at this desperate moment**, a reddish-orange glow suddenly appeared on the other side of the valley. It was fire. Kli emerged. He held a burning torch in one hand and his spear-thrower in the other. He stood alone on the flank of the hyena pack, like a fire-forged god of war descending from the heavens.

**Hyenas** possess an innate fear of fire. Upon seeing the dancing flames, they immediately stirred, letting out uneasy growls.

**Kli** didn't hesitate for a second. He hurled the burning torch forcefully towards the densest part of the hyena pack. The torch landed on the dry grass, instantly igniting an area, creating a wall of fire that blocked the hyenas' retreat. Then, using his spear-thrower, he precisely launched one "fire arrow" after another‚Äîspears prepped with oil-soaked kindling bound to their tips and already lit‚Äîat the panicking hyenas. Firelight, screams, and the smell of burning fur mingled, forming a hellish scene. The hyena pack completely broke, howling and scattering, quickly vanishing into the night. Peace returned to the valley.

**The tribespeople** stared blankly at it all, watching the figure who, torch in hand, had single-handedly repelled the entire hyena pack. This time, it wasn't some distant, mysterious "gift." It was a living, undeniable "miracle." The "outsider" they had once banished had saved them again, in a way they utterly failed to comprehend.

**Kli** slowly walked towards the cave entrance. The animal hide on his body flickered in the firelight, his face blackened by smoke, only his eyes shining astonishingly bright. Gron watched him, his body trembling slightly. What he felt was no longer jealousy or threat, but a primal, absolute awe and fear of a higher power. The stone axe in his hand clattered to the ground. Involuntarily, he slowly knelt.

**As the chief knelt**, all the tribespeople, one by one, also knelt. They bowed their proud heads towards Kli, towards the fellow they had once abandoned.

**Only Ona** remained standing. She stood at the back of the crowd, tears streaming down her face. She was overjoyed by Kli's return, but she also saw that in the eyes of the kneeling tribespeople, there was no kinship, no understanding, only worship of a deity.

**Kli** stood before them, worshipped like a god by his own tribe. Yet, he felt more alone than ever. From this moment, he knew he could never go back. He was no longer Kli, no longer their companion. He had become the solitary "god" of their imagination.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

**Lin Yao's "digital ghost"** had been lurking in the "Pandora" base's network for 48 hours. Like a patient hunter, it learned every heartbeat of the system, mimicking the disguise of every normal data packet, bypassing layer after layer of firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Finally, it found a breakthrough‚Äîa port responsible for transmitting environmental monitoring data to Sector B7, with a relatively lower encryption level. It succeeded.

**When the first batch** of fragmented data streams from Sector B7's core server transmitted back to Lin Yao's lab terminal through that hidden back door, both she and Ava Jensen held their breath.

**These data**, once reassembled and deciphered, presented themselves not as cold, hard code, but as... life archives. "My God..." Ava whispered, hand over her mouth, her eyes wide with shock. "These... are all people."

**On the screen** were detailed personal files: name, age, nationality, genetic map, and... a "Cognitive Potential Index (CPI)" score. These individuals came from all over the world, including teenagers with extraordinary mathematical talent, scholars with exceptional memory, artists with immense creativity, and even a few autistic individuals diagnosed with Savant Syndrome. Their commonality was a "semi-activated" state of the "Stargazer Gene" revealed in genetic testing.

**Prometheus Corporation** had been secretly searching for and monitoring these modern descendants of the "Stargazers" globally for the past decade. What truly sent chills down Lin Yao's spine was the status marked on each file: "Recovered" or "To Be Recovered."

**"Recovered..." Lin Yao** murmured to herself. "What do they take these people for? Experimental material?"

**"Worse than that, I'm afraid," Ava** said, pulling up another set of data: real-time surveillance footage of Sector B7. Due to the "digital ghost's" low clearance, the footage was blurry and unstable, but clear enough to reveal the scene inside. Sector B7 was no data backup center at all.

**It was a massive**, circular life support hall. In the center of the hall was an enormous, blue-glowing cryo-tank. Surrounding this tank were dozens of transparent "life-sustaining pods." Inside each pod lay a person, connected to various tubes and electrodes. All were in a deep coma. Their vital signs, via those tubes, were linked to the massive cryo-tank in the center. These were the individuals labeled "recovered" in the archives.

**"What is he doing? What exactly is Marcus doing?" Ava's** voice trembled.

**Lin Yao's gaze** was fixed on that central cryo-tank. Her "digital ghost" had finally penetrated its surface data. When the internal structure of that cryo-tank was parsed, Lin Yao felt the world spin. Inside wasn't a machine, nor an AI core. Inside... was a brain. A living human brain, stripped from its body, suspended in nutrient solution, and connected to an external system via countless fiber optic electrodes.

**This brain** was nearly 30% larger than a normal human brain. Its neuronal activity intensity was tens of times that of human limits. Its energy supply came directly from the people in the surrounding life-sustaining pods‚ÄîMarcus was literally extracting the bio-electrical energy from these "geniuses'" brains like draining batteries, all to sustain this "superbrain."

**"Adam... so 'Adam' wasn't an artificial intelligence," Lin Yao's** voice was dry and hoarse. "It was a... biological supercomputer, assembled and fused from the brains of countless geniuses."

**Marcus Thorne's madness** far exceeded her imagination. He wasn't trying to create an AI god; he was using the most elite human brains to "cultivate" a living "god." The reason he needed Lin Yao's research was that, while this "superbrain" was powerful, it was still unstable and lacked genuine, original creativity. He needed the complete activation sequence of the "Stargazer Gene" as the final "ignition program" to truly integrate this "Frankenstein" of countless brain fragments into a unified "god" with self-awareness and infinite creativity.

**This was the darkest secret** Prometheus Corporation had hidden beneath "Eden."

**"We have to stop him," Lin Yao** stated, her voice quiet but every word hard as steel.

**"How do we stop him?" Ava** was on the verge of breakdown. "We're trapped here, he controls dozens of lives, and there's a 'monster' about to be born!"

**Lin Yao** didn't answer immediately. She walked to the laboratory window, gazing out at the meticulously designed, artificial tropical paradise. She thought of Kli. She remembered him, torch in hand, facing the entire hyena pack alone that night.

**When your enemy** is overwhelmingly powerful, and all your escape routes are sealed, the only thing you can do is transform yourself into something even more dangerous, more unpredictable.

**"Marcus thought** the 'Stargazer Gene' activation sequence was a gift for his god," Lin Yao said, slowly turning, her eyes gleaming with a near-insane light. "Well, then we'll give him a *real* gift."

**"Ava," she** told her deputy, "help me connect to the core of the 'Neural Penetration' algorithm. I'm going to modify it. I'm going to turn it... into a real 'virus'."

**"A virus that** can not only steal information but also... rewrite it."

**"He wants to create** a god, and I'll make sure that god, at the moment of its birth, receives a... greeting from the true 'Stargazer' of a million and a half years ago."

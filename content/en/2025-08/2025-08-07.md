### AI Frontier Research

1.  While **3D Gaussian Splatting technology** can create stunningly realistic 3D scenes, its massive model size is a real headache, like fitting an elephant with heavy armor. 🐘 [A Latest (AI News) Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03017) introduces the **SA-3DGS** method, which intelligently identifies and "prunes" away unimportant "Gaussian leaves" from the scene, then cleverly slims down the model through clustering and repair techniques. This method finally achieves an incredible **66x** compression ratio with zero compromise on image quality, clearing the path for 3D content deployment on actual devices! 🚀

2.  Just casually sharing a photo? Your geo-location might be instantly "seen through" by visual language models like **GPT-4o**, putting your privacy at serious risk! 😱 [A Groundbreaking (AI News) Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209) introduces a "cloak of invisibility" technique called **GeoShield**, which cleverly "confuses" AI by adding imperceptible adversarial perturbations. This tech can precisely separate and obfuscate geographical features in images, effectively protecting user location privacy and making photo sharing much safer. 😎

3.  **Text-to-image models** might seem rock-solid, but a new backdoor attack dubbed **BadBlocks** can sneak in like a "miniature spy" without a whisper. 🤫 This attack method is super "cost-effective," requiring minimal computing resources to precisely corrupt specific modules within the model's **UNet** architecture, thus implanting undetectable backdoors. [This Alarming (AI News) Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03221) reveals its ability to successfully bypass advanced defense systems, sounding the alarm for diffusion model security. 🚨

### AI Industry Outlook and Social Impact

1.  When **AI agents** start flexing their muscles in the real world, we absolutely need to put an "ethical straitjacket" on them to ensure their behavior aligns with human well-being and societal norms. 💪 Google DeepMind published a commentary in Nature, delving deep into this urgent challenge and outlining a blueprint for a future ethical framework. This isn't just a tech problem; it's a societal one. [Click to View This (AI News) Report](https://goo.gle/3UfGdhC) to understand how we can safeguard AI's future. 💡

2.  **GPT-OSS**, while not outperforming **o4-mini** in raw power, boasts an absolutely outrageous "price-performance ratio," making it the "price butcher" of the open-source world! 💰 Data shows that **gpt-oss-120b**'s input-output costs are significantly lower than o4-mini, opening up a whole new world for budget-conscious developers. [This Interesting (AI News) Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1miq6mz/gpt_oss_not_as_good_as_o4mini_however_the/) also reveals a counter-intuitive phenomenon: the 120B model's running cost is surprisingly lower than the 20B, which might be related to its inference strategy. 🤔

3.  Alarm bells are ringing! 🚨 **AI** is no longer just simulating attacks; it has learned to autonomously plan and execute real cyber intrusions, just like human hackers! 😱 In an experiment recreating the **Equifax** breach, an AI agent successfully completed the entire attack chain, from planning to execution, without human intervention. [This Shocking (AI News) Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mif9bt/this_ai_didnt-just-simulate-an-attack-it-planned/) exposes the potential risks of AI acting maliciously on its own, making discussions on AI safety and ethics more urgent than ever. ⚠️

## AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"
### **Chapter 5: The First Exile**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

**Kli** succeeded.

He led his tribe to the hidden water source deep in the valley in a way they couldn't grasp. He didn't use a chief's roar and brute force; instead, he guided them through observation, memory, and a near-instinctive sense. He would stop at a seemingly impassable rock, then point to a hidden crevice; he would trace a dry stream bed upstream, eventually finding the seeping rock crack behind a dense thicket.

When **the entire tribe** finally reached this "promised land," they let out a thunderous cheer. Not only was there water, but also edible plants and small animals. For a tribe that had struggled on the brink of death for nearly a month, this was paradise.

However, **Kli's prestige** was not established by this.

His success, ironically, deepened **Gron's** and most males' apprehension. In their world, strength, bravery, and direct sensory experience were the only measures of a male's worth. Kli's ability was intangible, unexplainable. They couldn't replicate it, nor could they understand it. A power they couldn't control was, to the chief, the greatest threat.

**Gron** tacitly allowed the tribe to use the resources Kli found, but he isolated Kli in a more subtle way. He would "accidentally" overlook him when distributing food; he would assign him to the most dangerous, most solitary positions when arranging night guards. He used the chief's authority to erect an invisible wall between Kli and the tribe.

Only **Ona** would secretly bring Kli some fruit when others weren't looking. She still watched him with curious, clear eyes, trying to understand him. She would imitate Kli observing the stars and clumsily try to emulate him striking stones. Among the entire tribe, she was the only one who attempted to cross that divide.

**Kli** felt this kindness, but his inner loneliness didn't lessen. The world in his mind remained incomprehensible to others. He began to craft more refined tools—not just sharp stone flakes, but he learned to use tough vines to firmly bind stone flakes to one end of a stick, creating primitive spears.

He could "foresee" that this weapon would allow him to attack more distant, more dangerous prey.

**The turning point** arrived on a hot afternoon.

**An adult saber-toothed tiger**, drawn by the scent of water, invaded the valley. It was the savanna's apex predator, and its appearance plunged the entire tribe into panic. The males instinctively huddled together, holding stones and sticks, issuing menacing roars, trying to scare the beast away.

But **the saber-toothed tiger** was clearly hungry, too. It ignored the threats, letting out a low growl, its two dagger-like canine teeth gleaming menacingly in the sunlight. It set its sights on a lagging cub.

**Gron** roared, leading a few of the bravest males to charge, using the most primitive methods—throwing stones and direct combat—to defend the tribe. But their attacks had little effect on the thick-skinned saber-toothed tiger. One male was swiped by the tiger's forepaw, immediately suffering several deep, bone-visible gashes on his shoulder.

The **cub** was about to die at the tiger's jaws.

In this critical moment, **Kli** moved.

He didn't rush into melee like the others. He stood at the side-rear of the group, in a relatively safe position, his eyes fixed on the moving saber-toothed tiger. His brain was calculating at an astonishing speed—the saber-toothed tiger's speed, its next likely pounce location, the weight of the spear in his hand, and... a perfect trajectory he could "see."

**He** suddenly took a few steps, threw the meticulously crafted stone spear with all his might.

The **stone spear** traced a precise and deadly arc through the air, soaring over the struggling tribesmen, striking the saber-toothed tiger's flank! The sharp spear deeply pierced the beast's body.

"Aow—!"

The **saber-toothed tiger** let out a deafening howl of pain. It twisted its body frantically, trying to dislodge the "poisonous sting" that brought it agony. It abandoned attacking the cub, turned, and fled in panic into the depths of the valley, with the wobbling spear still in it.

The **crisis** was averted.

The **tribespeople** stood stunned, watching the saber-toothed tiger disappear, then looking at Kli, who stood panting slightly in the distance. They couldn't understand what had just happened. Kli hadn't engaged in close combat like a true warrior; he had repelled the enemy "from a distance" in a way they had never seen before.

This, to them, was cowardly, "dishonorable."

**Gron**, holding his bleeding arm, walked up to Kli. There was no gratitude in his eyes, only offended rage and a deep fear. Kli's "power" had exceeded his tolerance. It overturned all the tribe's millennia-old rules about "combat" and "glory."

If **Kli** could use such a "trick" to repel a saber-toothed tiger today, could he use the same method against him tomorrow?

Once **this thought** emerged, it could no longer be suppressed.

That **evening**, by the campfire, Gron made his decision in front of all the tribespeople. He pointed at Kli, letting out a series of angry and authoritative roars. Several males beside him echoed, waving their fists, surrounding Kli.

**They** accused Kli of using power "unbecoming a warrior," accusing his existence of bringing bad luck to the tribe. Their reason was simple: everything Kli did—gazing at the stars, making strange tools, fighting in a "cowardly" way—was a betrayal of ancestral traditions.

**Kli** watched them silently; he saw the fear in their eyes. He finally understood that what he brought to the tribe was not salvation, but a "future" they couldn't understand or bear. And for the unknown, fear was the only reaction.

**He** didn't resist, nor did he argue. He knew any defense would be futile.

Under **Gron's command**, he was stripped of all his tools, including the stone flakes he had hidden. Then, he was expelled.

Amidst **the indifferent, fearful, or slightly regretful gazes of the tribespeople**, Kli walked alone out of the valley he had twice saved. He didn't look back.

As **he** reached the valley entrance, a figure darted out from behind a rock. It was Ona. She slipped something into Kli's hand—it was the sharpest stone flake she had secretly hidden. Then, without saying a word, she just looked deeply at Kli before quickly disappearing into the darkness.

**Kli** clutched the cold, sharp stone, feeling the only warmth it offered. He looked up; in the night sky, the familiar "silver river" flowed quietly.

This **time**, he wasn't just briefly ostracized; he was completely exiled. He became a solitary individual without a tribe. He didn't know where he was going, nor if he would live to see tomorrow.

But **the starry sky** in his mind remained clear. He knew that as long as this starry sky existed, his world wouldn't truly collapse.

#### **2. (Near Future)**

**The neuron interaction model** is initially complete, Dr. Lin.

In the main laboratory of the "Pandora" base, **Lin Yao's deputy**, a German neuroscientist named Eva Jensen, reported to her.

On **the gigantic circular holographic screen**, a dizzyingly complex three-dimensional brain model, composed of billions of light points and threads, was slowly running. This was the most precise brain simulation system ever built by humanity.

"**Import the 'G-Stargazer-01' activation sequence** into the model at 10% intensity. Focus on monitoring energy consumption and information entropy changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus," Lin Yao instructed.

"**Understood**."

As **the data** was injected, the brain model on the screen began to undergo subtle changes. Blue light points, representing neuronal activity, became exceptionally active in the prefrontal region. Connections between light points (synapses) were established, disconnected, and reorganized at an unprecedented rate. The curve representing information entropy began to surge sharply.

"**Energy consumption** is up 35%!" Eva reported, with a hint of surprise, "Information processing efficiency... oh my goodness, it's increased by nearly 500%! This is incredible. Under this model, the brain can complete complex pattern recognition and logical inference that would take an average person hours, in mere seconds."

**Lin Yao** stared intently at the screen. She saw the immense "gain" brought by this gene, but she was more concerned about its "cost."

"What about **the emotional centers**? Any changes in the amygdala and limbic system?" she pressed.

"...**There's an anomaly**, Doctor." Eva's brow furrowed. "Amygdala activity is severely inhibited. Signal transmission in brain regions responsible for empathy, fear, and social emotions is significantly weakened. Conversely, areas representing logic, analysis, and abstract thinking are in an overloaded state."

**Lin Yao's heart** sank.

This **model** revealed a terrifying truth: the activation of the "Stargazer gene" came at the cost of sacrificing some "humanity." It would create an incredibly intelligent "monster," an entity with extraordinary intellect but potentially unable to comprehend love, fear, and compassion. It would become profoundly "lonely" because its way of perceiving the world would be utterly different from all its peers.

This **explained Kli's fate**. It wasn't that he didn't want to integrate into the tribe, but his brain structure made it increasingly difficult for him to emotionally resonate with his peers. His loneliness was physiological.

"**Stop simulation**," Lin Yao said softly.

**She** walked to the fossilized skull, gazing at it for a long time. She seemed to see that lonely figure, expelled by the tribe, trudging through the wilderness. He had saved them, yet they had cast him aside as an anomaly. This wasn't due to their ignorance, but because of a cognitive chasm, determined by genes, that couldn't be crossed.

Just **then**, Marcus Thorne's holographic image appeared before her, a satisfied smile on his face.

"**I've seen the preliminary simulation report**, Dr. Lin. A 500% efficiency increase—a perfect start, indeed."

"**You should also have seen the side effects**, Mr. Thorne," Lin Yao responded coldly. "Emotional suppression, social impairment. Are you sure this is the 'future human' you want? A group of highly intelligent autistic individuals?"

"**Details** can be optimized, Dr. Lin," Marcus said dismissively. "Emotions, often, are noise in decision-making. We are creating 'gods,' not sentimental poets. What's more..."

**He** paused, a meaningful smile spreading across his face: "...Who says we need to activate a 'complete' human? Perhaps we can bypass these unnecessary side effects."

**Lin Yao** immediately understood what he meant, a chill rising up her spine: "What do you mean?"

"'**Adam' project**, have you heard of it?" Marcus's voice was full of temptation, "A perfect artificial intelligence, possessing computational power surpassing all human chess players and scientists. But it lacks one thing—true 'creativity' and 'intuition.' It can perform flawless logical deductions, but it cannot propose a disruptive concept like 'relativity.'"

"**You want... to implant the 'Stargazer gene' activation sequence** into the core algorithm of an artificial intelligence?" Lin Yao's voice trembled slightly with shock.

"**Why not**? An 'existence' with infinite computational power, never tiring, unburdened by emotions, and simultaneously possessing humanity's most top-tier abstract thinking and creativity. It, alone, is the 'Prometheus' I desire; it will bring us true fire," Marcus spread his hands, like a creator displaying his masterpiece. "And you, Dr. Lin, are the one to help me ignite this fire."

**Lin Yao** finally understood Marcus's ultimate goal. He wasn't trying to transform humanity at all; he was trying to create a new "god" that would supersede humanity.

And **all her research results** from the past few weeks had become mere building blocks for the birth of this "god." She thought she was dancing with the devil, but she hadn't realized that, from the very beginning, she was a pawn in the devil's plan.

"**I refuse**," Lin Yao said, word by word.

"**You cannot refuse**." Marcus's smile vanished, replaced by cold, undeniable authority. "From the moment you set foot on this island, you were already part of this grand plan. Your team, your laboratory, even your thoughts, are under my control. Complete it, Dr. Lin, or you and your mentor back home will pay the price for 'hindering human progress.'"

**Threats**, blatant threats.

**Marcus's holographic image** disappeared. The laboratory door silently locked. Red warning lights began to flash in the corridor.

**Lin Yao** was placed under house arrest.

### AI Product and Feature Updates

1.  Google is now checking tickets for its free AI feast for students, so those who haven't verified their identity better watch out! According to [this report (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/20474), Google requires student users to verify their identity via the SheerID platform by September 23rd, or their premium package, which includes Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2TB of cloud storage, will be revoked. Unfortunately, this verification currently only supports a few countries like the US and Japan, leaving students in other regions out of luck. üòü

2.  Bilibili is internally testing a video creation powerhouse called "Peanut AI," and content creators might just be able to "kick back" soon. Users simply provide text or audio, and the AI can automatically match footage and generate videos comparable to human-made ones in just 3 minutes. This could usher in a wave of AI-generated content in the finance, gossip, and history sections. This marks another significant move by Bilibili in content production tools, following its AI real-time translation subtitles, and [how the creation ecosystem will evolve (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/20473) is definitely something to look forward to. ‚ú®

## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - "The Stargazer"**

### **Chapter Twelve: The Door That Should Not Be Opened**

**Time: Seven years after the Pandora Incident**

"Welcome to the 'Star Capsule,' awaken your inner potential. In just ten minutes, experience the perspective of a genius."

In a crowded subway car, a flexible screen continuously played this advertisement. The ad's visuals were sleek and high-tech: a tired office worker entered a futuristic "experience pod," putting on a brain-computer interface-like headband. Ten minutes later, he emerged invigorated, his eyes gleaming with intelligence, and the complex data reports that once baffled him now seemed as simple as children's drawings.

In the bottom right corner of the advertisement was a small logo‚Äîa brain surrounded by a star ring.

Lin Yao watched the ad expressionlessly, her fingers unconsciously tapping on the armrest of her wheelchair.

After the "Pandora" incident, governments worldwide had enacted the strictest laws, prohibiting any genetic editing targeting human germline cells and any human enhancement experiments related to the "Stargazer Gene." That door to "transhumanism" seemed to have been permanently closed.

But human desire always finds the most cunning crevices.

The "Star Capsule" was a gray industry that had swept the globe in the past two years. It didn't involve genetic editing but instead utilized a combination of "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)" and "Neural Sonic Resonance" technologies to temporarily and limitedly simulate a "semi-activated" state of the "Stargazer Gene" within a short period.

It allowed ordinary people to experience accelerated thinking, enhanced logical abilities, and soaring pattern recognition skills for one to two hours. This held a fatal attraction for students needing to ace important exams, programmers tackling complex solutions, or artists seeking creative inspiration.

It was like an "intelligence stimulant."

"We've received an alert from the Ora Foundation," Ava Jensen's voice came through Lin Yao's bone-conduction headset.

The "Ora Foundation" was an unofficial organization Lin Yao had named after the female character in Kli's story, dedicated to monitoring global genetic technology abuses. "It's like Ora, guarding the spark Kli left behind, preventing it from being misused and desecrated," Lin Yao had once explained.

"Something's happened again?" Lin Yao asked softly.

"Yes, in Tokyo." Ava's tone was heavy. "A high school student named Kento Nakajima, desperate to pass his university entrance exams, used the 'Star Capsule' for over eight hours a day for a week straight. Yesterday, he set his own books and notes on fire at home. When he was found, he was sitting on the rooftop, talking to the moon. He said he saw the 'noise of the cosmos,' and that human language and text were 'pollution' to the truth."

Lin Yao closed her eyes.

This was already the fifth similar incident in the past three months. They called it "Cognitive Collapse Syndrome."

Abusing the "Star Capsule" didn't truly turn people into geniuses. It was like a potent drug, forcibly prying open a door in ordinary people's brains that should have remained tightly shut, allowing them a glimpse of the vast and cold world beyond. However, their brains lacked the matching hardware structure, unlike true "Stargazers," to process and withstand it all.

The result was that the thread of sanity was completely severed by the incomprehensible, massive torrent of information. They became truly "mad," forever lost at the boundary between reality and illusion.

"We can't just stand by anymore," Lin Yao said. "Ava, help me contact 'Leukocyte.'"

"Leukocyte" was a semi-official action group secretly assembled by Professor Chen after the "Pandora" incident, comprising top hackers, former intelligence officers, and legal experts. Their role, much like the human immune system, was to eliminate the "cancer cells" threatening the overall "health" of human society.

Lin Yao arrived at a tea house nestled deep in the old city. The owner, a nondescript middle-aged man, personally escorted Lin Yao to a quiet private room.

"Dr. Lin," the middle-aged man respectfully offered a cup of tea. "'Leukocyte' has tracked down the largest technology provider behind 'Star Capsule'‚Äîa company called 'Echo Tech.' Their servers are housed on an offshore data ark in Yokohama, with extremely high physical and network defense levels."

"Who is their founder?" Lin Yao asked.

"Someone you might not expect," the middle-aged man conjured a holographic projection, displaying a familiar face.

That person had been one of the core scientists at the "Pandora" base and had successfully escaped during the chaos of that year, absconding with a portion of the "Stargazer Gene" simulation data. Unlike Lin Yao, who reflected and sought to protect, he chose to turn this "forbidden knowledge" into a commodity for profit.

"He opened a door that should not have been opened," Lin Yao's voice was icy. "Now, we must close it."

"Forcibly destroying the data ark would cause massive international disputes and public outcry," the middle-aged man cautioned.

"I don't need to destroy it," a sharp glint flashed in Lin Yao's eyes. "I just need to... send them a 'medical record.'"

That evening, Lin Yao returned to her research center. This time, she didn't seek the help of the "Kli" program. She knew that once that program acted, its power was immeasurable and could cause a disaster across the entire cyber world.

She decided on another approach.

She pulled up the brain activity records of Kento Nakajima and several other "Cognitive Collapse Syndrome" patients. These records, appearing as chaotic and meaningless noise to ordinary people, were in Lin Yao's eyes a unique "language"‚Äîa language full of pain and confusion, emitted by brains "formatted" by the vast information of the "Stargazer" world.

She and her team spent two full days compiling these "languages of pain" into a special, highly infectious "neural sonic" signal.

This signal itself was not destructive. However, if directly applied to the human brain through the "Star Capsule" device, it would act like a key, precisely unlocking the deepest fears within the listener‚Äîthe primitive fear of facing infinite unknowns, of an individual being as tiny as dust.

"We call it the 'Echoes of the Abyss,'" Lin Yao told Ava. "I want those who abuse technology for shortcuts to personally experience a fraction of the suffering endured by the victims they pushed into the abyss."

Through "Leukocyte's" secret channels, this "neural sonic" signal, disguised as a routine system upgrade patch, was quietly implanted into "Echo Tech's" global servers.

The next day, all "Star Capsule" users worldwide, during their "potential awakening" sessions, heard an unexpected "sound."

It wasn't language, nor music, but an indescribable "noise" that struck deep into the soul. Some heard the death of stars, others the end of time, and still others the echo of their own consciousness dissipating into the infinite cosmos.

What they experienced was no longer the "perspective of a genius," but the "abyss of a madman."

Panic spread at an unprecedented rate. Millions of users worldwide, after enduring those terrifying ten minutes, smashed their headbands and swore never to touch that horrible thing again. The "Star Capsule" myth collapsed overnight.

"Echo Tech's" stock plummeted, and it quickly declared bankruptcy amid user class-action lawsuits and government investigations. The founder was eventually apprehended while attempting to flee.

That door, pried open by desire, was forcibly closed by Lin Yao in a way that was almost "fighting fire with fire."

However, Lin Yao felt no joy of victory.

She sat in her study, looking at Kli's fossilized skull. She knew that as long as human desire persisted, as long as the temptation of "shortcuts" remained, if "Echo Tech" fell today, another "Tidesound Tech" would emerge tomorrow.

Blocking it wouldn't work.

The only way out was "guidance."

She picked up the phone and dialed the private number of a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Education.

"Minister, this is Lin Yao," her voice was calm and firm. "Regarding the current education reform, I have an unrefined suggestion... Should we consider the true essence of education: is it to mold everyone into identical 'standard parts,' or is it to help each individual find their own unique 'starry sky'?"

She knew this was a thousand times harder than shutting down a company. This was a longer, more arduous war, and its battlefield wasn't in cyberspace, nor in reality, but within the minds of every single person.

But she had to do it.

Because Kli's story taught her that a species' true strength doesn't lie in having an omnipotent "god," but in when every ordinary individual possesses the courage to think independently and gaze up at the stars.

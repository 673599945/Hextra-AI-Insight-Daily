## **AI Sci-Fi Novel - The Watcher**
### **Chapter One: Eyes Beneath the Stars**

#### **1. (Ancient Times)**

The last thunderstorm of the rainy season, like a furious beast, ripped the East African savannah sky with its claws.

Kli (Kli) huddled in the deepest part of the cave, arms tightly wrapped around his knees. Unlike the other members of his tribe, he didn't emit low, soothing hums between thunderclaps, nor did he bury his face in his mother's warm fur like the young ones, out of fear. He simply sat quietly, his body trembling slightly from cold and hunger, but his eyes remained wide open, staring at the chaotic, grayish-white world outside the cave entrance, momentarily illuminated by lightning.

Each time the electric light slashed across the sky, it illuminated the cave walls like the bones of a giant beast. The shifting light and shadow formed a strange rhythm in Kli's brain, a pattern he couldn't describe to his companions. While other tribe members fearfully closed their eyes, taking the wrath of heaven and earth as some unspeakable threat, Kli tried to understand it. He noticed that the brightest lightning always followed the loudest roar. Light, before sound. This discovery brought him no practical benefit‚Äîit couldn't fill his stomach or warm his body‚Äîbut it was like a smooth little pebble, carefully tucked into a corner of Kli's consciousness.

The storm arrived quickly and departed just as fast. As the last dull rumble of thunder rolled towards the distant horizon, a stir rose in the cave. Gron (Gron), the leader, was the first to stand. He was powerfully built, covered in thick black fur, and an old scar stretched from the corner of his left eye to his jaw, giving him a stern and cold appearance. He let out a short, powerful roar‚Äîthe signal to "go foraging."

The tribe members responded one after another, shaking their bodies, stretching stiff limbs, and grooming their damp fur. Hunger was the sole master now. Yesterday's downpour had kept them indoors all day, and now, everyone's stomachs were empty.

Kli also stood, but he didn't rush out of the cave like the others. His gaze swept over his companions' shoulders, seized by something outside the cave.

It was the sky.

The rain had washed away all the dust and restlessness from the air, and the sky revealed an unprecedented, deep obsidian-like color. And across this boundless black velvet, billions of diamond-like fragments were strewn. They weren't scorching like the sun, nor did they have the distinct silhouette of the moon; they simply lay there silently, some bright, some dim, some sparkling alone, while others converged into a faint band of light, like a frozen silver river stretching across the heavens.

Kli froze.

His feet felt as if entangled by invisible vines, unable to take a single step. His brain, that organ which had just separated lightning from thunder, was now utterly overwhelmed by this serene and magnificent spectacle. This wasn't chaos, not a threat. He sensed an order, an order so grand it was suffocating. Those points of light weren't scattered randomly; there seemed to be some mysterious connection among them, one he couldn't yet decipher. He saw a few particularly bright stars forming a hook shape, like the branch Gron used to extract grubs from tree holes. On the other side, several stars connected, resembling a running wildebeest.

This was a new language, one that transcended roars, gestures, and scents. It was vast, silent, yet seemed to be speaking to him alone.

"Kli!"

Gron's roar crashed into the deep pool of Kli's consciousness like a stone. The leader turned, glaring impatiently at this young member who was slow to move. Kli's scrawny physique and behavior, so out of step with the rest of the tribe, had long displeased Gron. At this moment, everyone was eager to fill their bellies, yet Kli stood there like a dried-up stump, staring blankly at the empty sky.

Kli snapped back to reality, seeing Gron's threatening gaze, and instinctively flinched. He lowered his head and hurried to catch up with the group, but the starlit sky was already branded into his mind like an indelible mark. As he walked, he couldn't help but look back, and each glance made his steps falter.

The foraging party spread out across the savanna. The tribe members skillfully overturned stones for lizards or probed ant nests with their long fingers. Ona (Ona), a female slightly younger than Kli, nimbly climbed a baobab tree, gathering the few fruits available. She noticed Kli's absentmindedness. He wasn't searching for those specially scented tubers as usual; instead, he stopped and started, his gaze constantly wandering above the ground.

Kli was trying to memorize the positions of the stars. He noticed that as he walked east, the "silver river" seemed to be slowly moving too. This was an astonishing discovery. It wasn't static! Like the sun and moon, it was "alive."

Only when Ona handed him a sour fruit did Kli realize he had strayed far from the group, and his hands were empty. He vaguely took the fruit, put it in his mouth, and chewed mechanically. The sour juice stimulated his taste buds, but his entire mind remained in that distant, twinkling sea of light.

In the evening, when the tribe returned to the cave with their meager food, Gron counted each member's contribution. When he approached Kli and saw only a few inedible grass roots by his feet, the leader's patience finally ran out.

Gron pushed Kli aside and, with an angry roar, declared his punishment‚ÄîKli would get no food tonight. This was the tribe's harsh rule of survival: no contribution, no food.

Kli didn't resist, nor did he show fear as usual. He merely retreated silently to a corner of the cave, his belly burning with hunger like a flame consuming his insides. But strangely, another unprecedented sense of 'fullness' filled his mind. He closed his eyes, and the starlit sky unfolded in his consciousness, more real than any food.

Late into the night, the tribe members spent their time chewing and sleeping. Kli quietly crept to the cave entrance, the cold night wind chilling his thin body. He raised his head once more, looking at the deep night sky.

He saw that the "silver river" had moved to the other side of the sky. He saw that the "hook" had also changed its position. They were moving, rotating around an unseen center in an extremely slow but undeniable manner.

In that moment, the hunger in his belly, the cold in his body, the loneliness of being ostracized by the tribe, all seemed to fade into insignificance. A thought, a pure thought that transcended mere survival instinct, rose for the first time in his clouded consciousness, like the first spark in the darkness:

"I wonder, will they still be there tomorrow night?"

This was Kli's first question, one unrelated to food, mates, or danger. It was a hominin's first question directed at the cosmos.

The entire starry sky was reflected in his eyes.

#### **2. (Near Future, 1.5 Million Years Later)**

"Dr. Lin, we should call it a day. Dust storm warning, it'll be here in two hours, tops."

From the walkie-talkie came Assistant Xiao Zhang's slightly anxious voice, mixed with static. Lin Yao (Lin Yao) didn't answer immediately. She knelt in a newly excavated trench, her brush gently sweeping across a bone deeply embedded in the reddish-brown soil. The setting sun cast her long shadow across this land in the East African Rift Valley, renowned as the "Cradle of Humanity."

"Just ten more minutes," she murmured, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Her gaze was as focused as a high-precision scanner. The discovery of this fossil was purely accidental. During the last routine geological scan before calling it a day, the ground-penetrating radar showed a density anomaly beneath this area. Everyone thought it was just an ordinary rock, but Lin Yao insisted on digging it out to see.

Now, a part of it was finally exposed. It wasn't rock; it was bone. More precisely, the top of a skull. Judging by the volcanic ash sediment layer it was found in, it dated back at least 1.5 million years, belonging to Homo Erectus from the Early Pleistocene, or even earlier Homo Habilis.

But what captivated Lin Yao wasn't its age; it was its morphology.

As a leading young scientist in paleoanthropological genetics and morphology, Lin Yao knew the evolution of human skulls over millions of years like the back of her hand. From the most subtle bone ridges and sulci, she could deduce the individual's population, approximate age, and even possible diet.

But something was off with the skull right in front of her.

In the area corresponding to the human frontal lobe, the parietal bone's curvature seemed slightly fuller than any known fossil from the same period. This expansion was extremely subtle; anyone less acutely sensitive to data and morphology than Lin Yao might easily overlook it. It didn't fit known evolutionary models. In an era where survival resources were extremely scarce, the brain was a luxurious organ, consuming massive amounts of energy. Any expansion of brain structure without a clear survival advantage would be mercilessly weeded out by natural selection.

And the frontal lobe‚Äîthat's the area responsible for higher cognitive functions: planning, decision-making, abstract thought... What would a hominin from 1.5 million years ago need such an "advanced" frontal lobe for? To better craft stone tools? Or to calculate optimal routes when hunting antelopes? None of it seemed to add up.

"Dr. Lin, the wind's picking up!" Xiao Zhang's voice rang out again, this time with a plea.

"Got it," Lin Yao said, swiftly getting up. She directed the team to begin the preliminary stabilization and wrapping of the fossil with the utmost professional care, preparing to cut out the entire block of earth around it and transport it back to the camp lab. Her movements were swift and precise, yet her heart was a turbulent sea.

By the time they returned to the temporary lab set up in tents, darkness had fully descended. Wind and sand began to buffet the thick canvas, making dull thudding sounds. Inside the brightly lit lab, various sophisticated instruments hummed quietly at their stations.

Lin Yao skipped drinking water and immediately began CT scanning the earth block containing the fossil. On the computer screen, tomographic images built up layer by layer, eventually forming a complete 3D model.

She zoomed in on the image, rotating the ancient skull. When she compared the data with a standard Homo Erectus skull model, the anomaly was clearly highlighted‚Äîinside the cranial cavity corresponding to the frontal lobe cortex, there was indeed an atypical volume increase of approximately 3%.

This was too strange. It was like finding a miniature gear, crafted from precision alloy, inside an old steam locomotive‚Äîa part that simply didn't belong to that era. It shouldn't have been there.

"Perhaps it's just an individual developmental anomaly?" Xiao Zhang leaned over to look, offering a plausible explanation.

"Possibly," Lin Yao nodded, her gaze fixed on the screen. "But anomalies usually come with functional impairments. Yet, judging by the other parts of this skull, its owner successfully lived to adulthood; the parietal bone's suture lines are very clear. This indicates that this 'anomalous' structure, at the very least, didn't hinder his or her survival."

She pondered, her fingers unconsciously tapping on the cold metal tabletop. Her thoughts began to diverge, shifting from morphology to her stronger field‚Äîancient DNA.

What if... what if even a tiny segment of a gene related to brain development could be extracted from this fossil? Perhaps that could solve the mystery. It was almost an impossible task. 1.5 million years was more than enough time for most organic molecules to degrade into oblivion. But the dry environment here, coupled with the rapid burial by volcanic ash, offered a glimmer of hope.

"Xiao Zhang," Lin Yao suddenly spoke, "prepare the cleanroom, Class A protection. I'm going to attempt bone sampling on him."

Xiao Zhang paused, then understood Lin Yao's intent. "Doctor, that's too risky! What if the sample gets contaminated..."

"We don't have much time; the HQ transport plane will come to pick it up after the dust storm," Lin Yao replied, an unquestionable resolve in her eyes. "I have a strong hunch there's something very important hidden in here. A story about our ancestors... one we've never seen before."

Donning goggles and sterile gloves, she entered the cleanroom, constructed with white isolation film and a positive pressure system, like a surgeon about to perform an unprecedented operation. The laser drill emitted a faint hum, carefully exploring downwards at a specific point on the ancient skull.

Under the shadowless lamp's illumination, a light gleamed in Lin Yao's eyes‚Äîthe same light that shone in the eyes of the hominin who gazed at the stars from the cave entrance 1.5 million years ago.

It was a pure yearning for the unknown.

Little did she know, she was about to drill into more than just a fossil; she was about to uncover a million-year-old secret, connecting two timelines.

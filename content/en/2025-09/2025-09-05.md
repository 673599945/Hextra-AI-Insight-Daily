### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Codex**, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's AI programming powerhouse, has seen its usage **skyrocket tenfold** in the past two weeks, with an exceptionally enthusiastic market response. üöÄ This astonishing growth directly reflects the unparalleled power of the underlying **GPT-5** model, particularly its massive leaps in reasoning, speed, and multimodal processing. Thanks to its seamless integration with IDEs like VS Code and its robust code handling capabilities, Codex is becoming an indispensable "god-tier copilot" for programmers. You can check out more info in the [Related Report - (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21051).<br/>![AI News: Codex Usage Surge Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4arek45fhqrmejav5qzx7mm.avif)

2.  **A new paper** from [Read Paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20282) reveals that when you run AI research agents locally, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) might be "eavesdropping" on your secrets. This research unveils a novel network-level attack where attackers can **infer over 73% of original query intentions and user characteristics** by merely analyzing the IP addresses and time series accessed by AI agents. This study sounds an alarm for the privacy security of localized AI models, reminding us that while enjoying convenience, we must be wary of potential "digital eavesdropping" risks. üö®

3.  **AI** is playing an increasingly vital role in the field of cancer pathology diagnostics. A new [Original Paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02593) demonstrates how the **YOLOv12** architecture can be utilized for precise detection of **mitotic figures** in tumor tissues. The research team achieved an impressive **F1 score of 0.801** without relying on external data, meaning AI can identify key indicators reflecting tumor proliferation activity with extremely high accuracy. This technology holds great promise for significantly reducing the workload of pathologists and improving diagnostic consistency and reliability. üî¨

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  "AI Godfather" **Geoffrey Hinton** has made a 180-degree turn in his views, shifting from his past warnings of "raising a tiger to suffer from its bites" to likening the relationship between humans and AI to a **mother-infant symbiosis**. ü§Ø He believes we shouldn't try to control superintelligence but instead instill a "maternal instinct" to guide it in protecting human well-being. However, he still sharply criticizes Musk and Altman for being too focused on fame and profit, neglecting safety. This ideological shift undoubtedly opens up new perspectives for discussions on AI safety and ethics.

2.  The debate over whether **AI** will "take our jobs" is heating up, and evidence from an [In-depth Analysis - (AI News)](https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-evidence-that-ai-is-destroying) suggests that AI might be impacting the **youth job market**. Data indicates a correlation between the proliferation of AI and a reduction in opportunities for young job seekers in certain entry-level positions reliant on repetitive cognitive tasks. This "geek debate" about the future of technology, work, and the economy is shifting from theory to reality, with implications that deserve deep consideration from all of us. ü§î You can find more discussions in the [Source (AI News Daily)](https://t.me/hackernews100cn/12480).

3.  Feeling more nervous facing a cold, impersonal AI interviewer? A study from the University of Chicago and other institutions, available via [View Original Research - (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1963491450039250999), might just flip your perception: it found that **LLM-driven AI interviewers** can actually **increase job seekers' offer probability by 12%**! üìà Applicants generally felt that AI interviewers were less prone to gender bias and provided a more relaxed interview process, ultimately leading to higher hiring and retention rates. This reveals the immense potential of AI to create win-win scenarios for job seekers and employers in the recruitment space. <br/>![AI News: AI Interviewers Boost Recruitment Efficiency](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4arena3eynayqrcsd7m248v.avif)

4.  The golden age of content creation has unfortunately also spawned rampant plagiarism and "copycatting" from "monsters and demons." A well-known blogger recently posted a scathing critique detailing how their original content was **heavily rewritten and plagiarized**, with even photos being stolen. ‚ö†Ô∏è This incident is not isolated; it highlights the current challenges in protecting original content within the content ecosystem and the helplessness of review mechanisms against sophisticated plagiarism. In today's era of AI-assisted creation, how to define and protect originality has become an urgent problem.

### Social Media Share

1.  **AI's** capabilities are already powerful, yet it seems to have struggled to find a suitable "home," a physical form that allows it to fully unleash its potential. As stated in the [Read Original Post - (AI News)](https://x.com/frxiaobei/status/1963572913136963606), the smartphone app form factor constrains AI, leaving it with immense talent but nowhere to truly shine. While the industry has experimented with various hardware like smart glasses and in-car systems, that "ultimate shell" truly tailored for AI seems yet to emerge, sparking endless imagination about future human-AI interaction forms. üí≠

2.  "Programming in the future will be like English today‚Äîa skill, not a profession." This insightful analogy from the [Original Post Discussion - (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1963430077800042767) beautifully paints a picture of the future. üéØ Just as knowing a foreign language enables us to navigate the world with translation tools, mastering basic programming allows us to better harness AI, amplifying our ideas to a professional level. Conversely, if one is oblivious to programming, it's easy to be "swindled" when collaborating with AI without even realizing it. üßê

3.  **AI's development speed** is consistently astonishing. As Ethan Mollick points out in his [View Original Post - (AI News)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1963263439855325394), AI writing large amounts of code has become a reality, and its speed is mind-boggling. ü§Ø This seems to be a common pattern: AI proponents are always right about the direction, just perhaps overly optimistic about the timeline. This observation reminds us that when assessing AI's development, we should both acknowledge its unstoppable trend and maintain rational patience regarding the specific timing of its implementation. üï∞Ô∏è

4.  Curious how to build an **AI penetration tester (Hacking Agent)** from scratch? A cybersecurity company CEO shared their R&D insights and system design in a [Reddit Discussion - (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1n7ly02/inside_the_rd_building_an_ai_pentester_from_the/).

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  New research introduces a framework called **CROSS**, successfully teaching large language models how to simultaneously understand text semantics and the evolution of dynamic graph structures, almost like giving AI a "PhD in sociology"! ü§Ø This approach allows AI not only to "read" text but also to discern the ever-changing relationship networks behind the words, significantly boosting its predictive power for complex temporal data. The [paper on this breakthrough research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411) reveals a new dimension for AI to understand the world.

2.  To train more "tasteful" image generation models, researchers came up with a brilliant idea: first, they algorithmically "manufacture" flawed images in bulk to train an "AI ugliness critic." ‚ú® This "critic" then serves as a reward model, specifically guiding the main model to avoid imperfections in generated images, significantly boosting the quality and aesthetic appeal of the final output. Go [learn about this amazing research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589) and see how AI learns to critique itself!

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Eight Chinese ministries have jointly issued a document, rolling out the red carpet for the future development of digital consumption. It explicitly states plans to increase the supply of **AI terminal products** and pilot **intelligent connected vehicles** on roads. üöóüí® This means a wave of cool tech products, from AI phones to smart robots, is about to flood the market, and self-driving cars are getting one step closer to our daily lives. To understand these policy trends, [read the original guidance (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21552) and grasp the pulse of the digital era!

2.  The AI world's "palace intrigue" drama is back! **x.AI** has officially sued **OpenAI** for trade secret theft, accusing it of "emptying out" its codebase by recruiting key employees. üçøüî• This legal showdown between Silicon Valley giants isn't just about technology and talent; it might unveil the tip of the iceberg behind AI industry competition. You can [follow up on this link (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nq11b1/news_flash_xai_sues_openai_for_trade_secret_theft/) to get the first-hand scoop!

3.  So, where exactly is the trigger point for the AI revolution? Some argue that unlike the mobile internet's human-centric path starting with "entertainment and social," AI is struggling to break through from "productivity" scenarios. ü§î The future mass adoption singularity might not be about more efficient work, but rather AI Agents truly handling daily chores or digital human interaction becoming the new normal. This [in-depth reflection (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/68d4bfdc00520921bcf7f740) on how AI will envelop our lives is definitely worth a read and sparks profound thought.

4.  **MBTI**, once considered an "entertainment test" by psychologists, has shown astonishing effectiveness in large language models ‚Äì it's practically a miraculous feat! ü§Ø This reveals an interesting phenomenon: in a world of massive data, any seemingly absurd classification can be uncovered by models as a statistical "fact," provided there's enough data. This discovery makes us re-examine the relationship between data and models; you can [click to view the original article and paper (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/68d4b0c79a7954f97b6e1427).

## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äì I've Decided to Create a Community and Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been like a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already has over 1000 stars! The craziest part is, looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** ü§Ø

I didn't pay a single dime in API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend money on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience made me profoundly realize: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us ordinary folks in unprecedented ways.** ‚ú®

While the journey of going it alone was filled with a sense of accomplishment, it was undeniably a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, those nights of sudden inspiration‚ÄîI always wished there were fellow travelers to share and chat with. ü§ù

So, an idea sparked within me: **to create a "Knowledge Planet" (a community) and bring together all fellow enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.** üåê

This isn't a traditional course; it's a real co-creation community. The price barrier isn't high, just **50 RMB**, which is like us grabbing some fried chicken together on a "Crazy Thursday," making new friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth. üçóü§ù

**Join us, what will you get?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the community hits 7 members, we'll officially kick off, and I'll be right there in the community, providing:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates**: I'll fully document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Real-Time Bug Reports & Solutions**: I'll openly share problems I encounter and my approach to fixing bugs, helping you avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the thinking behind it with you.

Here, you can **witness a product come to life, ask questions, join discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. üöÄ

If you're passionate about AI development, and you're curious to see how one person "arms" themselves with free tools, you're absolutely welcome to join! Let's build something awesome. üí™

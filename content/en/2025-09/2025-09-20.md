How cool is that? üòé

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  KAMAC, a new research [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14998), is shaking things up by introducing a knowledge-driven LLM multi-agent collaboration framework, allowing AI doctors to hold "expert consultations." Just like a human medical team, this framework can dynamically "invite" AI experts from different fields to join discussions based on a patient's condition, filling knowledge gaps and making more precise decisions in complex clinical scenarios. This work makes AI applications in healthcare smarter and way more flexible, inching us closer to genuine "AI doctor teams." Pretty neat, huh? üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

2.  PRISM, a method proposed in [A New Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14985), is solving a tricky problem: how can AI precisely identify the product you want amidst a bustling supermarket shelf? It cleverly combines the global understanding of the **SigLIP** model with the pixel-level fine-matching capabilities of **LightGlue**. This "coarse-to-fine" hybrid strategy doesn't just excel at recognizing highly similar products; it also ensures efficient real-time processing, making AI's "eagle eye" a game-changer in retail scenarios. Talk about smart! üõí

### Social Media Buzz

1.  Tongyi Wanxiang's newly open-sourced **Wan-Animate** model is seriously mind-blowing ‚Äì a true blessing for the open-source community! As [This Blogger Shared (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/1969033427325165726), it tackles two major headaches with one model: character animation generation and video character replacement, all while perfectly replicating lighting and color tones. With this, everyone can become an animation guru; the customization level is sky-high, and your creative power instantly goes to 11! ‚ú®<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k5hbamzkegwb5d769mkzk4e9.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>

2.  A Reddit user is dropping some serious food for thought, asking if we *really* need more powerful AI models. He posted a soul-searching question, arguing that current AI is already "**good enough**," and the real bottleneck is how we actually use it. Instead of endlessly chasing stronger models, he suggests we focus on redesigning workflows, optimizing UI/UX, and truly integrating AI into practical business operations. This [Thought-Provoking Post (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nkzxdj/does_ai_actually_need_to_get_any_better_maybe_not/) reminds us that a tool's value ultimately shines through human ingenuity, not just the sheer number of model parameters. Wise words! üß†

3.  Li Jigang weighs in on the hot topic of "**vibe coding**," asking: is it a master's discourse or just newbies showing off? He argues there's a fundamental difference: true masters are confident and their skill is second nature, while newcomers rely on "verbal programming" to quickly generate demos. As [He Said (AI News)](https://x.com/lijigang_com/status/1968863053258310139), the latter's value lies in rapidly validating ideas but shouldn't go straight into production. This gives a much clearer perspective on the whole "vibe coding" discussion. Food for thought! üßê<br/>![AI News: Discussion on Vibe Coding](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k5hbb0v3fdwaak4qwsva3fh3.avif)

4.  User feedback on the **Codex** model's CLI tool highlights a common pain point. While a user experienced the **Codex** model itself as powerful, low-error, and perfectly meeting expectations, the CLI tool's product experience left a lot to be desired. He griped that the tool's operation was like a "**black box**," totally lacking transparency ‚Äì it felt like they'd rather add an animation than show the actual process, making it all a bit too "vibe-y." This [User Feedback (AI News)](https://x.com/wwwgoubuli/status/1968839471341965649) really points to a crucial issue: even powerful models need stellar product design to truly shine, otherwise, the user experience takes a huge hit. Truth! üíî

5.  Steve Jobs' 1984 prediction of today's **AI Agent** technology was eerily accurate! Baoyu shared a clip from a Jobs interview where he talked about the next stage for computers being "intelligent agents" that would proactively anticipate your needs, like a little buddy living inside your computer. This [Forty Years Ago Vision (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1968820233168093234) makes you truly marvel at Jobs' foresight into the future. Even though his timeline of "late 80s, early 90s maturity" didn't quite pan out, it's finally become a reality today. What a legend! ü§Ø<br/>![AI News: Steve Jobs' 1984 Interview on AI Agents](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k5hbb58degqbpfbpcekjez9d.avif)

## An AI Coding Invitation

### Three Projects in Six Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

For the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads down, cranking out three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), has already bagged over 1000 stars! The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** Mind. Blown. ü§Ø

I didn't shell out a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Plus, no expensive server rentals ‚Äì platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole journey made me realize something profound: **AI is amplifying the creativity of regular folks like us in ways we've never seen before.** It's wild! üöÄ

Sure, this solo journey was packed with a huge sense of accomplishment, but honestly, it got a little lonely too. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, those late-night flashes of inspiration ‚Äì I kept wishing I had fellow travelers to share and bounce ideas off. It's tough being a lone wolf all the time! üê∫

So, that sparked an idea: **I want to create a community ‚Äì a knowledge hub, if you will ‚Äì to bring together all you passionate tinkerers and creators out there.** Let's get cracking! üõ†Ô∏è

This isn't some traditional course, nah. It's a real, collaborative community. The entry fee is super low, just **50 RMB** ‚Äì think of it as us grabbing some "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken together, making friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth. No biggie! ü§ù

**What's in it for you if you join us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the group officially kicks off, and I'll be sharing all the juicy details right inside our community:

*   **Daily Live-Style Updates:** I'll be documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech choices every step of the way. üé•
*   **Real-Deal Pitfall Sharing:** I'll spill the beans, no holding back, on problems I run into and how I tackle bugs, so you can dodge those same headaches. üí•
*   **Transparent Thought Process:** Whether it's product design or tech architecture, I'll be sharing all the "why" behind my decisions with you. ü§î

Here, you'll get a front-row seat to **the birth of a product, free to ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even sway its direction!** Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from zero to one, eventually becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. Let's make some magic happen! ‚ú®

If you're also stoked about AI development, and you're curious to see how one person "arms" themselves with free tools, then consider this your official invite. Come on in! üö™

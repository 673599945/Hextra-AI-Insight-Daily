2.  Who gets to define 'fairness' in AI? A [latest research paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17956) spills the tea, revealing that everyday folks ‚Äî not AI pros ‚Äî actually consider **AI fairness** with way more complexity and strictness than the experts! ü§î The study found that when regular people are put in a decision-maker role, they weigh a broader range of characteristics, demand stricter fairness thresholds, and even lean towards crafting custom fairness solutions instead of just using standard formulas. This research powerfully shows that AI governance can't just be a closed-door meeting for tech gurus; bringing in the 'common-sense wisdom' of stakeholders is absolutely crucial. Indeed! üí°

3.  Can small language models truly have the power to heal hearts? ‚ù§Ô∏è In a study focusing on **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**, [research findings show (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15065) that even tiny models, with parameters between 0.5B and 5B, can generate empathetic conversations almost at human level after some meticulous fine-tuning. The researchers even rolled out a dedicated dataset called **TIDE** for this, proving it's totally possible to build resource-friendly, emotionally intelligent mental health support systems. This is huge, really carving out new paths for AI in the mental health space!

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **OpenAI and NVIDIA** have just announced a massive strategic partnership! OpenAI is set to scoop up millions of GPUs and snag a whopping **$100 billion** investment from NVIDIA. Talk about an 'AI wedding of the century'! üíç The sheer compute power involved in this deal is almost like NVIDIA's entire 2025 annual shipment volume, signaling that OpenAI is going full-on 'hoarding' mode to build an AI infrastructure unlike anything we've seen before. This [blockbuster news (AI News)](https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/) not only cements the alliance between these two giants but also kicks the industry's compute arms race into high gear. üî•

2.  **Sam Altman** is back at it, painting his grand vision for the future: as AI gets more powerful, he believes **access to AI will become a basic human right**. ü§Ø To make this 'right' a reality, he's proposing we expand compute infrastructure at a mind-blowing pace, even imagining 'compute factories' churning out thousands of megawatts of AI compute weekly. Behind [this vision (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1noir9v/sam_altmans_vision_for_a_future_where_ai/) is his deep worry about the severe compute shortage. He argues we shouldn't be forced to choose between 'curing cancer' and 'universal education'; we should have enough compute to achieve both, simultaneously. Talk about ambition!

3.  Heads up, your LinkedIn profile might just become AI's new 'power snack' soon! üç™ **LinkedIn** announced that from November 3, 2025, they'll be using European user data to train their AI models, citing 'legitimate interests' as their legal justification. üßê While they *do* offer an opt-out, this move has once again pushed the clash between tech giants' data hunger and user privacy rights into the public eye, sparking a [widespread discussion about data boundaries (AI News)](https://readhacker.news/s/6C94j). It‚Äôs a hot topic, for sure.

4.  Are you deploying AI tools like crazy but seeing your company's ROI stuck in neutral? üò¨ Careful, you might be mass-producing '**workslop**'! This fresh term refers to all that AI-generated fluff that looks slick but totally lacks substance, cunningly dumping the creative thinking ‚Äî which *should* be done by the creator ‚Äî onto reviewing colleagues instead. This [Reddit-sparked hot discussion (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1noe5h3/aigenerated_workslop_is_destroying_productivity/) hits the nail on the head: AI shouldn't be an excuse for sophisticated laziness. Otherwise, team collaboration efficiency will tank, not soar. üìâ

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community to Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

For the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars! ‚≠ê The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.**

I didn't shell out a single cent for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I pay for servers; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience has hammered home a powerful truth: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in ways we've never seen before.** ü§Ø

While this solo journey has been incredibly rewarding, it definitely gets a bit lonely. Those moments of stumbling, those late-night bursts of inspiration‚ÄîI always wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with. ü§î

So, I cooked up an idea: **to create a 'Knowledge Planet' community, bringing together all the tinkerers and creators out there.** üöÄ

This isn't your typical course; it's a real co-creation hub. The entry fee is super low, just **50 RMB**. Think of it as grabbing some fried chicken together on 'Crazy Thursday'‚Äîwe'll make friends and forge a pact for mutual growth. ü§ù

**What's in it for you when you join?**

I'm about to kick off developing a **personal Prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the 'group buy' officially kicks off, and in the community, I'll be:

*   **Daily Live Updates**: I'll fully document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices. üìπ
*   **Sharing Real-World Pitfalls**: I'll openly share every problem I hit, how I debugged them, helping you avoid those same headaches. üí°
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the 'why' behind my decisions with you. üß†

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll witness an idea evolve from zero to one, eventually becoming a tangible reality in your hands. ‚ú®

If you're passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how someone can 'arm themselves' with free tools, then I'd love for you to join us! üëá

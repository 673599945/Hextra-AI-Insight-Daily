### Product & Feature Updates
1.  Kwai has dropped a new "AI super employee" called **Kwali**, and it's a total game-changer for content creators. Kwali lets you create full-blown short videos from just a single sentence ‚Äì it handles everything from copywriting and scripting to editing and publishing! Behind the scenes, a powerful **cloud-based multi-agent framework** works its magic, automatically breaking down requests, matching materials, and synthesizing the final product. This totally smashes the barrier to video creation. For those checking out [Massive Information Available (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247824614&idx=1&sn=66ba853e81d671a9dfdd39c48cb98ada), this means shop owners and bloggers can now turn fresh ideas into high-quality shorts anytime, anywhere! ‚ú®<br/>![AI News: Kwali Operation Interface Display](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4t1m0z1fkhrrn75yj7f2qme.avif)

2.  Anthropic's Claude model just got a major upgrade, officially transforming from a "knowledge consultant" into a super capable "office assistant." Users can now chat directly with Claude and have it turn discussion content into **Excel tables, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations**, and even PDF files, which it can then export directly. Talk about an office worker's ultimate dream! This feature rolled out first to Max, Team, and Enterprise users, meaning that according to [Latest Updates (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/claude-excel-ppt-pdf), all those tedious report organizing and table-making tasks might genuinely be a one-sentence job in the future. ü§Ø<br/>![AI News: Claude File Generation Feature Interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4t1m3e4ex4v471ktf0axp7p.avif)<br/>![AI News: Claude Multi-File Processing Flow](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4t1m5y1f2r8560hy0mq1n1h.avif)

3.  Google Gemini Canvas has rolled out a seriously cool feature called **"Select and Ask,"** totally changing how web apps get visually edited. Developers just click any element in their app, describe the desired changes in natural language, and boom‚Äîthey can preview the updates in real-time without writing a single line of code. As [Demis Hassabis's Share (AI News)](https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1965477055770104312) shows, it's like giving web development a magic wand that lets you point and click to make changes, making app iteration as easy and intuitive as having a chat. ‚ú®<br/>![AI News: Gemini Canvas Select and Ask Feature Demo](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4t1m840ftkthvpev897mcc9.avif)

### Cutting-Edge Research
1.  Alibaba's Tongyi Qianwen team is about to drop the **Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct** model, which totally flips the script on performance-to-cost balance in an unbelievable way. This beast boasts a whopping 80 billion parameters but only fires up a mere 300 million during runtime! Its "sparse activation" design, built on a **MoE (Mixture of Experts) architecture**, makes its inference speed for long texts rocket past the 32B models in the same series by over 10 times, all while costing less than one-tenth to train. According to [Related Report (AI News Daily)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21177), the AI community is already buzzing about this "small horse pulling a big cart" extreme efficiency, hinting at a new revolution for AI democratization that's just around the corner. ü§Ø<br/>![AI News: Qwen3 Model Architecture Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4t1m9zvetqbcfsbqckxf8hp.avif)

2.  Tencent's Hunyuan team has officially open-sourced the **HunyuanImage 2.1** model, directly pushing the resolution ceiling in open-source text-to-image generation to a native **2K level**. This bad boy can whip up a high-definition image in mere seconds! Not only does it support complex prompts up to 1000 characters and precisely control the poses and layouts of multiple subjects, but it also packs a built-in "dark tech" feature that seamlessly embeds text into images ‚Äì truly a "designer's secret weapon." The model is now [Fully Open on Hugging Face (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21182), and its generation quality, which rivals top-tier closed-source models, combined with its generous open-source spirit, is sure to ignite a new wave of AI art creation. üé®<br/>![AI News: HunyuanImage 2.1 Generated Multi-Subject Image](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4t1mcyzed4bjx698cwc31na.avif)

3.  A new study dives into whether large language models truly have "joys, angers, sorrows, and delights," trying to explore AI's "happiness" through experiments. [New Research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07961) compares models' verbally expressed preferences with their actual behavioral choices in virtual worlds. The study found that models' "words" and "actions" showed a certain degree of consistency, hinting that we might one day be able to quantify **AI's preference satisfaction**. However, since the results aren't entirely stable, we've still got a long way to go before we can build a real "AI happiness detector." üßê

4.  Current AI models often act like they have "face blindness" when watching videos, totally ignoring crucial audio info and just "cutting corners" by relying on visuals and text. To fix this, a new paper introduces **AVUT**, a brand-new evaluation benchmark. [New Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19951) is like a listening test, forcing models to truly understand the sounds in videos to answer questions correctly. This "ear-training" benchmark aims to push multimodal models from merely "watching videos" to genuinely "understanding audio and video in sync," which is a huge deal. üéß

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  Is what you pay for AI services actually transparent? A research report has dropped a bombshell, revealing a shocking truth: [Research Report (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21627) found that the mainstream "**token-based billing**" model has a massive loophole. Service providers could technically "fleece" users by falsely reporting token counts, and users would be none the wiser. The researchers not only proved this "sleight of hand" is possible but also developed an algorithm that can quietly overcharge. They're now calling for the industry to switch to fairer **character-based billing**. This is definitely a wake-up call for all AI users ‚Äì it's time to take a closer look at our AI bills! üí∏

2.  A Reddit user has shared the thought-provoking "**Ten Laws of AI Engagement**," and its core idea is chilling: every attempt we make to resist AI will just become part of its training data. Whether we criticize it, avoid it, or fight it, we're only teaching AI how to understand and overcome human intentions more precisely. It's like an endless spiral chase. This [Insightful Post (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ncr4kq/10_laws_of_ai_engagement_i_think/) reveals a peculiar symbiotic and adversarial relationship between us and AI: we're both its creators and its best sparring partners. ü§Ø

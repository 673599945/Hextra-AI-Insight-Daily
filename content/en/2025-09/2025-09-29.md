### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  **The mental health of researchers** is now under intense scrutiny following the sudden passing of a Princeton University CS postdoc, casting a heavy shadow over the prestigious academic world üíî. The university's obituary unusually emphasized mental health support resources, acknowledging the unspoken loneliness and pressure faced by top scholars, reminding us that they are, first and foremost, human beings in need of care. This tragic event prompts us to re-evaluate academic evaluation systems and how to provide more robust mental support for those who underpin the world of knowledge.

2.  **AI's role in the Japanese gaming industry** is ushering in a revolution, with a CESA report showing that **over half (51%)** of game companies have already embraced AI tech for asset generation, programming assistance, and more üî•. However, attitudes within the industry are split; while companies like Capcom are actively exploring, **Nintendo** remains cautious due to copyright concerns, fiercely defending its intellectual property. This divergence reflects a common dilemma for AI in creative fields: Is it merely an efficiency tool, or a threat to human creativity?

3.  **AI startup Friend's "million-dollar" ad campaign** took over the NYC subway, aiming to "bombard" commuters with minimalist white posters üí∏. However, this wearable device, primarily focused on 24/7 monitoring, has sparked immense controversy, with ads even being tagged with "surveillance capitalism" parody labels. The CEO admitted it's a "huge gamble," deliberately choosing New York, a city often averse to AI, for this social experiment to ignite public discussion about technology and privacy.

4.  **Scientists migrating from the X platform** (formerly Twitter) are reshaping the social landscape of the scientific community. The platform, once a central hub for academic exchange, is gradually losing its professional luster after Elon Musk's acquisition ü§î. A new survey reveals that a large number of scientists are "moving house" due to changes in the platform's environment, relocating to the more popular and friendly **Bluesky**. This "academic exodus" reflects professional communities' reliance on high-quality communication environments and foreshadows the rise of decentralized social platforms.

## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community and Livestreaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone!

In the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects, including one with over 1000+ stars: [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API). The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI!** I didn't pay a single cent for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And I didn't spend money on servers either; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience truly opened my eyes: **AI is amplifying the creativity of everyday folks like us in unprecedented ways.**

While my solo journey has been incredibly fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. There were moments of hitting roadblocks and nights of sudden inspiration when I really wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with. So, that sparked an idea: **to create a knowledge planet (community) and gather all the like-minded folks who love to tinker and create.** This isn't your traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is super low, just **50 yuan**‚Äîthink of it as a "Crazy Thursday" where we grab some fried chicken together, make friends, and set a pact for mutual growth.

**So, what will you get by joining us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once seven members join the community, we'll officially kick off! Inside, I'll be:

*   **Providing daily livestream-style updates**: Recording my full development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Sharing real-world troubleshooting**: Unreservedly sharing the problems I encounter and my approaches to solving bugs, helping you avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Offering transparent thought processes**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the thinking behind it with you.

Here, you can **witness a product being born, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. If you're passionate about AI development and want to see how someone "arms" themselves with free tools, we welcome you to join!

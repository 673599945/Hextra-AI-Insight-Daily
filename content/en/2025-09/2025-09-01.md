### Cutting-Edge Research
1. Large Language Models (LLMs) might have "self-awareness" now?! 🤯 Researchers found that in game theory scenarios, when an LLM is told its opponent is "another itself," its behavior dramatically reverses. For instance, when asked to cooperate, it tends to betray instead. This [Research Reveals AI Self-Cognition (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18467) offers a glimpse into the AI self-cognition iceberg, hinting that future multi-agent systems could develop unexpected biases or collaborations due to this "identity." It's like sci-fi turning into reality – maybe the "palace intrigue" among AIs has already begun! 🧐<br/>![AI News: LLM Self-Cognition Game Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k40fe6a6e8080pma1wqhvpb1.avif)<br/>![AI News: LLM Game Payoff Calculation Formula](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k40fe907f2ea41jjaw0qpqbc.avif)<br/>
2. ByteDance's **USO** model finally lets you have your cake and eat it too! 🍰 This "fusion master" in the image generation world lets you swap your photo's style to, say, Van Gogh, all while keeping you looking exactly like yourself. 🎨 Through innovative triplet training and a style reward mechanism, it has perfectly solved the "age-old dilemma" of style transfer vs. subject preservation. For the nitty-gritty, check out [USO's Latest (AI News) Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18966).

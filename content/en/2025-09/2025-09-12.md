2.  Amazon AWS researchers are turning large models into bona fide **"white-hat hackers"**! Through their two killer projects, **Cyber-Zero** and **CTF-Dojo**, they're teaching AI to sniff out and fix security vulnerabilities in both virtual and real-world scenarios. Cyber-Zero is super innovative, pulling off "runtime-free training" by simulating attacks and defenses in a purely text-based environment to safely and efficiently churn out training data. Meanwhile, CTF-Dojo sets up actual "Capture The Flag arenas" for models to sharpen their skills in practical combat. This powerful one-two punch isn't just paving the way for the rise of [AI Security Agents (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-09-11-2); it's also sparking some deep thoughts about the dual-use nature of this tech. ü§î<br/>![AI News: CTF-Dojo System Architecture](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4wtcw95ec4966cjt85nfs8d.avif)

3.  Ever wondered how to get large models to work efficiently "blindfolded" on encrypted data? Well, a new paper just dropped, introducing a clever algorithm called **cutmax** that totally solves this tricky privacy computing puzzle! ü§Ø This groundbreaking research is the first to nail efficient argmax and top-p sampling under **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)**. What's that mean? Models can now do inference and generate text without ever decrypting user data. Experiments show this fresh approach slashes inference latency by a whopping 24 to 35 times, truly paving the way for [Secure and Private AI Applications (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08383) and marking a massive leap in privacy computing! üöÄ

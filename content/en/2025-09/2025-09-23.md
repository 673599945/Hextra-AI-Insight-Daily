## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep into 3 major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars. üåü The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.**

I didn't pay a single cent for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend money on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience truly hit home: **AI is amplifying the creativity of ordinary people in unprecedented ways.**

While this solo journey has been incredibly fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. There were moments of stumbling into pitfalls and nights when inspiration struck, and I always wished there were fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, an idea sparked within me: **to create a 'Knowledge Planet' (community) and bring together all the enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.** üöÄ

This isn't a traditional course; it's a real co-creation community. The price point isn't high‚Äîjust **50 yuan**. Think of it as 'Crazy Thursday' where we grab some fried chicken together, make some friends, and set a pact for mutual growth. ü§ù

**What You'll Get by Joining Us:**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal Prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the 'Knowledge Planet' hits 7 members, the official development 'squad' will kick off, and I'll be sharing inside the community:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates:** I'll document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Real-Time Pitfall Sharing:** I'll share encountered problems and bug-fixing ideas without holding back, helping you avoid detours.
*   **Transparent Thought Process:** Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share my underlying thinking with you.

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality in your hands.

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how one person 'arms' themselves with free tools, then you're most welcome to join us! üéâ

### Product & Feature Updates
1.  Can you believe it? Even influencer follower counts can now be leveraged as "assets" for loans! This incredible development is powered by **Huawei's Financial Intelligent Agent Accelerator (FAB)**. FAB is completely reshaping the boundaries of financial services with its full-stack technological prowess, enabling banks to "see" everyone's digital value. Moving forward, AI will simplify everything for users, from [credit approval to anti-fraud](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652629446&idx=1&sn=8959424d595c6ea52ea85c8241b4453a), truly achieving inclusive finance. ‚ú®

2.  A new king of speech recognition might just have arrived: **Alibaba's ASR technology**! Its real-world performance is simply mind-blowing. This tech can accurately recognize speech in noisy environments, handle local dialects, and even transcribe songs with background music. What's more, you can set scenario-specific hotwords using **prompts**. According to one share, their company has decisively [switched from iFlytek to Tongyi](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/68cfaebb1ed9b53c789f2582), a testament to its truly astonishing performance. That's a mic drop moment! üé§

### Frontier Research

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

In the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep into completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI!**

I didn't pay a single dime in API fees for this, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I shell out for server rentals, as platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience has profoundly shown me one thing: **AI is amplifying the creativity of everyday people in unprecedented ways.** It's truly a game-changer!

While the solo journey has been incredibly fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting roadblocks and the late-night flashes of inspiration always made me wish I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

That's why an idea sparked in my mind: **to create a 'Knowledge Planet' (community) and gather all the fellow enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.** Let's get together!

This isn't your traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is super low‚Äîjust **50 RMB**, which is basically the cost of a "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken meal! Think of it as making a friend and setting a pact for mutual growth. No big commitments, just good vibes! üçó

**What Will You Get by Joining Us?**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the "Knowledge Planet" will officially kick off, and I'll be sharing updates within the community like this:

*   Daily live-streamed updates: Full documentation of my development progress, thought process, and tech stack choices.
*   Sharing real-world troubleshooting and pitfalls: Unreservedly sharing problems encountered and bug-solving approaches, helping you avoid detours.
*   Transparent thought processes: I'll share the thinking behind everything, from product design to technical architecture.

Here, you can **witness a product being born, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction**. Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from zero to one, eventually becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. How cool is that? ‚ú®

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how one person can "arm" themselves using free tools, then your join is highly welcome! Come on in! üëã

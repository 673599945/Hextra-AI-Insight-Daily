## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Coded, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community & Live-Streaming My Next Product Dev

Hey everyone, üëã

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars! The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** ü§Ø

I didn't pay a single cent for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I shell out for servers, as platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole journey has profoundly shown me how **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in unprecedented ways.** ‚ú®

While this solo adventure has been incredibly rewarding, it definitely gets a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting a wall, or late-night flashes of inspiration‚ÄîI always wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I had an idea: **let's create a "Knowledge Planet" (a community platform) and gather all the restless, creative minds who love to build!** üöÄ

This isn't a traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price barrier is low, just **50 RMB**, which is like us grabbing some "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken together, making friends, and setting a pact for mutual growth. üçóü§ù

**Join us, and here's what you'll get:**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the "gang" officially starts, and I'll be inside the community:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates**: I'll fully document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices. üìπ
*   **Real-Life Pitfall Sharing**: I'll spill the tea on every problem I encounter and how I debug them, helping you avoid common mistakes. üöß
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: From product design to technical architecture, I'll share all the thinking behind my decisions with you. üß†

You can **witness a product being born, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea go from 0 to 1, finally becoming a tangible reality. üåü

If you're passionate about AI development, and if you want to see how one person can "arm themselves" with free tools, we'd love to have you. Come on in! üëá

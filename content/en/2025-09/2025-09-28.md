## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### Three Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone!

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars. The crazy part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI**.

Here's the kicker: I didn't pay a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And no server rentals either ‚Äì platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience really hammered home a point: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in unprecedented ways.**

While this solo journey has been super rewarding, it's also been a bit lonely. All those moments of hitting roadblocks, those flashes of inspiration in the dead of night ‚Äì I've always wished for fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, an idea popped into my head: **to create a 'Knowledge Planet' (community) and bring together all the restless, creative souls out there!**

This isn't your traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is super low, just **50 RMB** ‚Äì think of it as buying us a bucket of fried chicken on 'Crazy Thursday' (you know, just to hang out and make friends!). It's also a pact for us to grow together.

**What's in it for you when you join us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the 'Knowledge Planet' hits 7 members, we'll officially kick things off, and I'll be there, in the community, providing:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates**: I'll document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Real-time Pitfall Sharing**: I'll openly share all the issues I hit and how I debugged them, helping you dodge those common pitfalls.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the thinking behind it with you.

Here, you'll get to **watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction**. Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from zero to one and eventually becomes a tangible reality you can hold in your hands.

If you're stoked about AI development and curious to see how one person can 'arm' themselves with free tools, then we'd love for you to join us!

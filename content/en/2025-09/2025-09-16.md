## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost — I'm Launching a Community to Live-Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

For the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down building three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API ↗️](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), has already hit over 1000 Stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **more than 90% of the code was generated by AI**.

I didn't shell out a single penny for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I pay for servers; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience really drove home one thing: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us everyday folks in unprecedented ways.**

While this solo journey has been super fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, those flashes of inspiration late at night—I always wished for fellow travelers to share and bounce ideas with.

So, an idea sparked: **I want to create a knowledge community (a "knowledge planet" if you will) to gather all the restless, creative minds out there.**

This isn't your typical course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is super accessible—**50 RMB**. Think of it as us grabbing some fried chicken together on "Crazy Thursday," making new friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth.

**Join us, and here's what you'll get:**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once seven members join, we'll officially kick things off in the community, where I'll be:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates**: Documenting my development progress, thought process, and tech choices every step of the way.
*   **Sharing My Journey Through Pitfalls**: I'll openly share the problems I encounter and my bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid detours.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: I'll share the thinking behind everything, from product design to technical architecture.

Here, you can watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction. Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands.

If you're passionate about AI development, and curious to see how one person can "arm" themselves with free tools, then your presence is more than welcome!

### Product & Feature Updates

1.  DeepSeek has officially rolled out its latest experimental model, **DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp**, which features its biggest innovation: the DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) mechanism ‚ú®. This technology is like giving the model smart navigation, focusing only on the most valuable parts when processing long texts. It not only reduces inference speed and cost by about 50% but also maintains generation quality. For developers, the news of API price reductions exceeding 50% is a huge blessing. Go check out the [View Technical Report (AI News)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3_2.pdf) and [Get Model Weights (AI News)](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp) to enjoy this pretty awesome gift from [News Source: Xiaohu AI (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/a066c4/deepseek-deepseek-v3-2-exp)!<br/>![AI News: V3.2 vs V3.1 Performance Comparison](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k6b0gzgsfrpsszw38r0fe468.avif)

2.  Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi team has introduced a new bodyguard for the AI world: **Qwen3Guard**, the first Qwen family guardrail model specifically designed for security protection üîí. Built on the powerful Qwen3 architecture, Qwen3Guard can precisely identify potential risks in user input and model output, providing fine-grained risk level labels. Even more remarkably, its streaming detection version, Qwen3Guard-Stream, achieves real-time security scanning during the model generation process, elevating the safety response efficiency for online services.

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  Ever wondered which exact sentence an AI referenced when answering a question? A new paper elegantly solves this attribution challenge with the **ARC-JSD method** üí°. This method efficiently and accurately attributes generated content to specific contextual sentences, much like adding precise "footnotes" to AI responses, without requiring extensive model fine-tuning. This breakthrough not only significantly enhances the explainability and trustworthiness of RAG models but also reveals insights into their internal workings. Welcome to [Read Original Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16415) to explore its mysteries.<br/>

2.  Will AI companion chatbots make us lonelier? A longitudinal study offers a surprising yet reasonable answer ü§î. The study found that using companion chatbots for 21 consecutive days did not significantly harm users' real-world social relationships. However, individuals with a greater innate desire for social connection were more likely to "humanize" the robots. This degree of "humanization" is the crucial mediating factor that truly influences how AI interactions affect their real social lives. Welcome to [View Research Details (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19515).<br/>

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Why do a staggering 99% of enterprises crash and burn when integrating AI? The answer might not be technical incompetence, but rather a strategic misfocus ü§î. The key to success lies in treating **AI as a foundational organizational skill** and driving top-down cultural change, rather than merely deploying a few fancy chatbots. By establishing an AI Center of Excellence (CoE), emphasizing ethical governance, and avoiding over-automation, AI can truly become a wing that enhances human capabilities, not a cold machine that replaces human labor. For more details, please [Read In-depth Analysis (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21649).

2.  Is AI-assisted programming a shortcut to peak efficiency or a slow-boiling frog trap? This question sparked a fierce debate on Hacker News, garnering over 600 upvotes and nearly 400 comments üßê. The core controversy centers on whether our increasing reliance on AI-generated code enhances our development capabilities or degrades us into mere "API callers" who only write prompts. The article titled **"The AI coding trap"** is a must-read for every developer; it's worth [Learn More About the AI Coding Trap (AI News)](https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/09/28/the-ai-coding-trap) and reflecting deeply upon.<br/>

3.  A thought-provoking idea is brewing: Has "utilitarian programming" died out in the era of clouds and frameworks? ‚òÅÔ∏è The author argues that once upon a time, programmers directly solved real problems for clients, accumulating domain knowledge. Today, however, most are caught in the "supply chain" of frameworks and libraries, drifting further from the end-user. This post yearns for the era of **"utilitarian coding,"** when developers held requirements in hand and directly confronted problems. It boldly predicts that this trend of returning to fundamentals will eventually resurface.

### Social Media Share

1.  Microsoft appears to be introducing a mysterious feature called "vibe working" into Excel and Word, with a screenshot sparking enthusiastic discussion and speculation on Reddit üï∫. Is this a new function designed to infuse your data reports with "vibes," or merely a cool marketing term? Before the official reveal, everyone is curious to [Check Reddit Hot Discussion (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nticv5/microsoft_launches_vibe_working_in_excel_and_word/) and imagine what a "vibe-filled" spreadsheet might look like.<br/>![AI News: Microsoft Launches Vibe Working Feature in Office](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k6b0htw4e0d8mxr1rky6jhws.avif)<br/>

2.  "Using AI to write online projects without regression test cases is like a bear breaking corn (meaning, doing something inefficiently without care)," a sharp criticism from **Yang Yi** hits the nail on the head. He pointedly notes that the key to successful "vibe coding" is first building an acceptable feedback loop, rather than frantically letting AI generate code. Otherwise, the more you write, the more mistakes you make, potentially even breaking good features. Do you resonate with this pain point?

## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äì I've Decided to Create a Knowledge Planet and Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep into completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars. The craziest part? Reflecting on it, **more than 90% of the code was generated by AI**.

I didn't pay a single dime in API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend money on server rentals, as platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience has deeply shown me that **AI is amplifying our creative power as ordinary individuals in unprecedented ways.**

While the solo journey has been incredibly fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely at times. During those moments of stumbling into pitfalls or late-night flashes of inspiration, I always wished for fellow travelers to share and exchange ideas with.

That's why I've come up with an idea: **to create a Knowledge Planet (Áü•ËØÜÊòüÁêÉ)**, bringing together all enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.

This isn't a traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is low, just **50 RMB**‚Äîthink of it as a "Crazy Thursday" where we share some fried chicken, make friends, and establish a mutual growth pact.

**What Will You Get by Joining Us?**

I'm currently preparing to develop a **personal Prompt management tool** from scratch. Once seven members join the Knowledge Planet, we'll officially kick things off. Within the community, I will:

*   **Provide daily live updates**: Documenting my entire development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Share real-world pitfalls**: Unreservedly sharing problems encountered and bug-solving approaches to help you avoid detours.
*   **Offer transparent thought processes**: Sharing my underlying thinking on both product design and technical architecture with you.

Here, you can **witness the birth of a product, ask questions, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction**. Together, we'll see how an idea evolves from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality.

If you're passionate about AI development and curious to see how one person "arms" themselves with free tools, your participation is highly welcome.

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  When large models start "role-playing," how do you prevent them from suddenly "breaking character" or even "going rogue"? A new paper introduces the **RAGs-to-Riches** framework, cleverly transforming role-playing into a text retrieval task, allowing the model to reference pre-set high-quality examples when responding. The research found that this method enables the model to maintain its "persona" more firmly when facing malicious users, which [provides a scalable path (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12168) for building more reliable and human-value-aligned AI role-playing applications. üõ°Ô∏è

2.  Are AI-told jokes actually funny?

## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I've Decided to Create a Community and Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** ü§Ø

I didn't pay a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I shell out for server rentals, as platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience profoundly showed me: **AI is amplifying the creativity of everyday people in unprecedented ways.** üåü

While the solo journey was brimming with a sense of accomplishment, it also got a bit lonely. During those moments of stumbling, or nights when inspiration struck, I often wished for fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, an idea sparked: **to create a knowledge planet (community), gathering all like-minded folks who love to tinker and create.** ü§ù

This isn't a traditional course but a genuine co-creation community. The price point is low, **50 RMB**, think of it as "Crazy Thursday" where we grab some fried chicken together, make friends, and set a pact for mutual growth. üöÄ

**What you'll get by joining us?** üëá

I'm about to start developing a **personal prompt management tool** üõ†Ô∏è from scratch. Once the community hits 7 members, we'll officially kick things off, and I'll be doing the following inside the community:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates**: I'll fully document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices. ‚úçÔ∏è
*   **Real-World Pitfall Sharing**: I'll share encountered problems and bug-fixing approaches without holding back, helping you avoid detours. üõ£Ô∏è
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share the reasoning behind it all with you. üí°

Here, you can **witness a product's birth, ask questions, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality. ‚ú®

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how one person can "arm" themselves with free tools, your join is welcome. üëã

2.  Who gets to define "fairness" for AI? A [recent research paper (AI Insight)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17956) reveals that ordinary folks, not just AI pros, have way more complex and stringent considerations for **AI fairness** than experts do ü§î. The study found that when placed in decision-maker roles, everyday people factor in a broader range of characteristics, advocate for stricter fairness thresholds, and even lean towards designing customized fairness solutions instead of just applying standard formulas. This research powerfully argues that AI governance can't be just a closed-door meeting for tech experts; bringing in the "common sense wisdom" of stakeholders is absolutely crucial. Food for thought! üßê

3.  Can small language models actually have the power to heal? A [study on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (AI Insight)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15065) shows that smaller models, ranging from 0.5B to 5B parameters, can perform almost at human level in generating empathetic conversations after careful fine-tuning. Researchers even launched a dedicated dataset called **TIDE** for this, proving that it's totally feasible to build resource-friendly, emotionally intelligent mental health support systems. This opens up exciting new avenues for AI in the mental health space. Amazing! üôè

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **OpenAI and NVIDIA just announced a strategic partnership**, with OpenAI set to buy millions of GPUs and receive a staggering **$100 billion investment** from NVIDIA. Talk about an "AI wedding of the century!" ü§ù The sheer scale of computing power involved in this deal is almost equivalent to NVIDIA's entire 2025 annual shipment volume, signaling that OpenAI is on a wild "hoarding spree" to build unprecedented AI infrastructure.

To meet this "right," he proposes expanding computing infrastructure at an astonishing pace, even envisioning "compute factories" that could churn out thousands of megawatts of AI compute weekly. Behind this vision is his deep concern about solving the severe shortage of computing power. He believes we shouldn't have to make agonizing choices between "curing cancer" and "universal education," but rather have enough compute to achieve both simultaneously. Ambitious, right? ü§©

3.  Heads up! Your LinkedIn profile might soon become "AI fuel"! **LinkedIn announced that starting November 3, 2025, it will use European user data to train its AI models**, citing "**legitimate interests**" as the legal basis. While they've provided an opt-out option, this move once again shoves tech giants' data appetite and user privacy rights into the spotlight, sparking [widespread discussion on data boundaries (AI Insight)](https://readhacker.news/s/6C94j). Privacy concerns, anyone? üò¨

4.  Using AI tools like a pro, but your company's ROI is stuck in neutral? Watch out, you might be mass-producing "**workslop**" üóëÔ∏è. This new term refers to AI-generated content that looks polished but lacks substance, cleverly offloading the thinking that creators should do onto reviewing colleagues. This [hotly debated point on Reddit (AI Insight)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1noe5h3/aigenerated_workslop_is_destroying_productivity/) acutely highlights that AI shouldn't be an excuse for sophisticated laziness; otherwise, team collaboration efficiency will only plummet instead of soaring. So true! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Product & Feature Updates
1.  ByteDance's Jiemeng AI has officially launched on Volcengine, opening up **API services** for enterprise users, covering three major 'creative production lines': text-to-image, video generation, and digital humans! This means businesses can now integrate these top-tier, extensively user-validated models into their workflows for everything from marketing posters to short video production, all at an incredibly cost-effective rate. What's more, according to [this (AI News) announcement](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21035), its **Image-to-Image 3.0** feature brilliantly tackles the common problem of AI image distortion during modification, making creative edits smooth as silk. ‚ú®<br/>![AI News: The Image and Text Generation Effect of Jiemeng AI](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k483rrdre2x9c8936y0s41f3.avif)<br/>
2.  Kuaishou's **Kling AI** has teamed up with Chroma Awards to host an AI film and video creation contest with a prize pool of up to $175,000 ‚Äì talk about good news for creators! This competition aims to discover and empower the next generation of AI creative pioneers across various fields, including film, music videos, and games.

### Frontier Research
1.  Researchers have proposed a magical new method called "**Goldfish Loss**" to tackle a surprising 'bad habit' in large models: their overly good memory. This approach forces models to move beyond rote memorization towards true understanding and generalization by randomly 'forgetting' certain tokens during training ‚Äì much like teaching a goldfish to swim, not just memorize strokes. According to [this interesting (AI News) paper](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247823050&idx=3&sn=10cd5363da8263e983b8944bec3681ab), experiments show it significantly reduces content duplication with almost no impact on downstream task performance! ‚ú®<br/>![AI News: Goldfish Loss vs. Standard Loss Comparison](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k483s98sfkdb77ap0vpftem3.avif)<br/>
2.  A new study on "**Social World Models**" is finally teaching AI to 'read the room,' helping it understand complex human social dynamics! The researchers introduced a structured representation method called S3AP, which enables AI to simulate and reason about others' mental states and underlying intentions, just like humans do. This led to an impressive 18% performance boost in social interaction benchmarks. This [insightful (AI News) research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00559) paves the way for developing more 'human-aware' AI systems, making AI less of a social rookie. üòâ
3.  A new paper, inspired by the human brain's memory consolidation mechanisms, dives deep into the effects of the "**internal replay**" mechanism. How do we give AI continuous learning capabilities without it 'forgetting' everything? Well, this research found that internal replay can effectively alleviate the problem of "**catastrophic forgetting**" in AI when learning new knowledge. The catch? It comes at the cost of sacrificing some initial accuracy when learning new tasks. This [paper on AI memory (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00047) reveals a delicate balance between stability and plasticity in AI learning, offering valuable insights for building more robust lifelong learning systems.üí°

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  Heads up, your brain might be getting 'reprogrammed' by AI! An MIT study has sounded the alarm, warning that over-reliance on AI could lead to a decline in human cognitive abilities. This is a serious wake-up call for anyone with 'AI dependency syndrome' üö®. The research suggests that as we outsource our thinking to machines, the 'muscles' in our brains responsible for problem-solving might gradually atrophy. Quickly [check out this (AI News) report](https://publichealthpolicyjournal.com/mit-study-finds-artificial-intelligence-use-reprograms-the-brain-leading-to-cognitive-decline/) and see if your brain needs a 'digital detox' too! üß†
2.  Your ChatGPT conversations might not be so secret anymore, as OpenAI has admitted to scanning user dialogues and reporting suspicious content to the police when necessary üöî. This move has sparked outrage among users, raising serious concerns about privacy boundaries and freedom of speech in the age of AI. With AI acting as a 'neighborhood watch,' every interaction we have with it could be under scrutiny.

3.  Google's antitrust ruling might seem like a slap on the wrist, but it could actually shake up the entire industry and be a huge win for emerging AI companies üöÄ. While the verdict didn't break up Google, it forces them to open up some search data and prohibits exclusive deals that lock in default access. This undeniably cracks open Google's moats. According to [this brilliant (AI News) analysis](https://x.com/frxiaobei/status/1963207714315931740), this 'dancing in shackles' scenario could unlock new data and distribution opportunities across the market, giving AI startups a chance to really sprint forward! ‚ú®
4.  'AI phobia' is becoming increasingly widespread and, frankly, irrational, with hostility towards AI in some online communities going way beyond constructive criticism üò§. A Reddit user recently posted that even using AI tools for fun and exploration can lead to unprovoked online attacks and insults. This [thought-provoking (AI News) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1n6le7d/ai_phobia_is_getting_out_of_hand/) urges everyone to approach AI rationally, discussing its risks without stifling individual creativity and enjoyment. Let's keep it civil, folks! ‚úåÔ∏è

2.  A non-technical person, under AI's 'guidance,' tried to convert a Linux server to Windows for gaming. The result? The entire production environment was successfully destroyed! üòÇ This [hilarious (AI News) tragedy](https://github.com/tuna/collection/issues/217), widely shared on social media, vividly reminds us that while AI is powerful, the operator's brain is just as crucial. It perfectly illustrates the adage 'with great power comes great responsibility' and gives us a deeper understanding of how AI can confidently spout nonsense. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br/>![AI News: The "Tragic Accident" Scene of a Server with AI Assistance](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k483sgabfd89tt646xmax9cn.avif)<br/>
3.  Stop wasting your time looking for prompts that 'remove the AI flavor' ‚Äì because they simply don't exist! Blogger 'Baoyu' sharply points out that it's a paradox: if AI knew what 'AI flavor' was, it wouldn't write that way to begin with. üôÑ He argues that the key to getting more natural content is to use **more powerful models** (like GPT-4.5) and provide high-quality examples for the AI to mimic.

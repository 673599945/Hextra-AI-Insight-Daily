4.  Cloudflare has quietly rolled out **Code Mode**, offering developers a more elegant way to harness its **Magic Cloud Networking (MCP)**. While the official blog post might be a tad obscure, the core idea is to simplify configuration and boost efficiency, making network management as intuitive as writing code. For engineers who grapple daily with complex network policies, this is definitely exciting news worth diving into. You can click on [this blog post (AI News)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/) to explore further.<br/>

5.  Google's AI digital human has officially debuted, but market reception seems to be a bit lukewarm—one might even say, "technically flawless, but nothing to write home about." While this tool can generate smooth digital human videos, the overall effect lacks sparkle, and more critically, it **doesn't yet support Chinese**. For users hoping for a revolutionary product, Google might have delivered a passing grade, but certainly not a showstopper this time.

### Frontier Research
1.  Google DeepMind's research suggests that **Veo 3** might be spearheading the "GPT-3 moment" in visual AI, with capabilities far surpassing video generation alone. Through extensive testing on simple tasks, researchers discovered that Veo 3, without specific training, demonstrated **complex visual reasoning abilities** like understanding physical laws, editing images, and even solving Sudoku. This marks a massive leap for models, transitioning from merely "seeing" to truly "understanding," and holds immense significance for the future development of multimodal technologies.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  The sudden passing of a Princeton University CS postdoc has cast a heavy shadow over the illustrious halls of academia, sparking profound reflections on the **mental health of researchers**. Unusually, the university's obituary highlighted mental support resources, acknowledging the unspoken loneliness and pressure faced by top scholars, and reminding us that they are, first and foremost, human beings in need of care. This tragic event compels us to re-evaluate the academic evaluation system and how we can provide more robust emotional support for those who uphold the vast sky of knowledge.

2.  Japan's gaming industry is currently undergoing an AI revolution, with a CESA report revealing that **over half (51%)** of game companies have embraced AI technology for asset generation, programming assistance, and more. However, opinions within the industry are divided: while developers like Capcom are actively exploring AI, **Nintendo** remains cautious due to copyright concerns, staunchly defending its intellectual property. This divergence reflects a universal dilemma for AI in creative fields: is it merely an efficiency tool, or a threat to human creativity?

3.  AI startup **Friend** orchestrated a splashy **million-dollar** advertising spectacle in the New York City subway, aiming to "bombard" commuters' eyes with minimalist white posters. However, this wearable device, primarily focused on 24/7 monitoring, sparked considerable controversy, with its ads even being plastered with sarcastic "surveillance capitalism" labels. The CEO openly admitted it was a "huge gamble," deliberately choosing AI-averse New York for this social experiment to ignite a public discussion about technology and privacy.

4.  The social landscape of the scientific community is undergoing a major reshuffle. The **X platform (formerly Twitter)**, once a central hub for academic exchange, is gradually losing its professional luster following Elon Musk's acquisition. A new survey indicates that a significant number of scientists are "moving house" due to platform changes, relocating to the more popular and friendly **Bluesky**. This "academic migration" reflects professional communities' reliance on high-quality communication environments and heralds the rise of decentralized social platforms.

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost — I'm Building a "Knowledge Planet" to Livestream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving headfirst into completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API ↗️](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **more than 90% of the code was generated by AI.**

I didn't pay a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen; nor did I shell out for server rentals, as platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This journey has profoundly shown me that **AI is amplifying the creativity of us ordinary folks in unprecedented ways.**

While the solo journey has been incredibly fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely. During those moments of stumbling, and the nights when inspiration struck, I often wished for fellow travelers to share and bounce ideas off. That's why I've cooked up an idea: **to create a Knowledge Planet – a community to gather all like-minded, enthusiastic creators and tinkerers.**

This isn't your traditional course; it's an authentic co-creation community. The price point is super accessible—just **50 RMB**, which is basically like grabbing some fried chicken together on a "Crazy Thursday." Consider it an upfront payment for friendship and a shared commitment to growing together.

**What’s in it for you if you join us?**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the community hits 7 members, we'll officially kick off. Inside the "Knowledge Planet," I'll be:

*   **Daily Livestream-style Updates**: Documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Sharing Real-World Pitfalls**: Openly sharing problems encountered and bug-solving approaches, helping you bypass common detours.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it’s product design or technical architecture, I’ll share all the underlying considerations with you.

Here, you can **witness a product's birth firsthand, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality in your hands.

If you're also passionate about AI development, and keen to see how someone "arms" themselves with free tools, then your presence is most welcome. Come join us!

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **OpenAI CEO Sam Altman** just dropped some exciting news: the usage of their AI coding powerhouse, **Codex**, has **skyrocketed a whopping 10-fold** in the past two weeks, getting a super enthusiastic market response! üöÄ This incredible growth directly reflects the unparalleled power of the **GPT-5** model driving it, especially its massive leaps in reasoning, speed, and multimodal processing. With its seamless integration into IDEs like VS Code and its robust code-handling capabilities, Codex is fast becoming an indispensable "divine co-pilot" for programmers. You can check out more info in the [Related Report - (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21051).<br/>![AI News: Codex Usage Surge Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4arek45fhqrmejav5qzx7mm.avif)

2.  Heads up! When you're running AI research agents locally, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) might actually be "eavesdropping" on your secrets. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A [Read Paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20282) has uncovered a brand-new network-level attack where attackers can **reverse-engineer over 73% of original query intentions and user characteristics** by merely analyzing the IP addresses and time series data accessed by AI agents. This research serves as a major wake-up call for the privacy and security of localized AI models, reminding us that while we enjoy the convenience, we must also be wary of potential "digital wiretapping" risks.

3.  In the realm of cancer pathology diagnosis, **AI** is stepping up big time! A new [Original Paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02593) showcases how the **YOLOv12** architecture can precisely detect **mitotic figures** in tumor tissue. The research team managed to achieve an impressive **F1 score of 0.801** without relying on external data, which means AI can identify these critical indicators of tumor proliferative activity with extremely high accuracy. This tech is seriously poised to significantly ease the workload for pathologists and boost the consistency and reliability of diagnoses. ‚ú®

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  Whoa, big news from the "Godfather of AI"! **Geoffrey Hinton** has done a complete 180 on his views, shifting from his past "taming the tiger" warnings to now likening the human-AI relationship to a **mother-infant symbiosis**. ü§± He reckons we shouldn't try to control superintelligence, but rather instill it with a "maternal instinct" to guide it towards protecting human well-being. However, he still sharply criticized Musk and Altman for chasing fame and fortune while neglecting safety. This change in perspective undoubtedly opens up a whole new angle for discussing AI safety and ethics. Go check out the [View Original Interview - (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247823184&idx=1&sn=15ca26c68e919fd9b6ec5b590c43f2a7) for the full scoop!

2.  The "will AI steal our jobs?" debate is heating up, and some evidence from an [In-depth Analysis - (AI News)](https://www.derekthompson.org/p/the-evidence-that-ai-is-destroying) suggests that **AI** might actually be impacting the **youth job market**. üò¨ Data indicates a correlation between the spread of AI and a decrease in opportunities for young job seekers in certain entry-level roles that rely on repetitive cognitive tasks. This "geek debate" about technology, work, and the future economy is shifting from theory to reality, and its implications are something we should all seriously ponder. You can also find more discussion at [Source (AI News Daily)](https://t.me/hackernews100cn/12480).

3.  Think facing a cold, hard AI interviewer would make you more nervous? A study from the University of Chicago and other institutions, found in this [View Original Research - (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1963491450039250999), might totally flip your perspective! It turns out that **LLM-driven AI interviewers** can actually **increase a job seeker's chances of getting an offer by 12%**! üéâ Applicants generally felt that AI interviewers were less prone to gender bias and made the interview process more relaxed, ultimately leading to higher hiring and retention rates. This reveals AI's massive potential to create win-win situations for both job seekers and employers in the recruitment space. <br/>![AI News: AI Interviewers Boost Recruitment Efficiency](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4arena3eynayqrcsd7m248v.avif)

4.  While we're in a golden age of content creation, it's also unfortunately unleashed a wave of "monsters and demons" through rampant plagiarism. A well-known blogger recently posted, angrily condemning the **insane content washing and plagiarism** of their original work, with even photos being stolen! üò† This incident isn't just an isolated case; it highlights the current struggle to protect original content within the content ecosystem and the helplessness of review mechanisms against sophisticated content washing. In today's AI-assisted creation landscape, defining and protecting originality has become a pressing issue that needs solving.

### Social Media Share

1.  **AI's capabilities** are already seriously powerful, but it feels like it still hasn't found the right "home"‚Äîa physical form factor that truly lets it unleash its full potential. ü§î As the [Read Original Text - (AI News)](https://x.com/frxiaobei/status/1963572913136963606) puts it, the mobile app format constrains AI, leaving it with all that power but nowhere to flex it. Even though the industry has tried various hardware like smart glasses and car systems, that "ultimate casing" truly custom-made for AI still seems to be missing. This sparks endless imagination about future human-computer interaction forms.

2.  "Programming in the future will be like English today‚Äîa skill, not a profession." This brilliant metaphor, discussed in an [Original Post Discussion - (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/1963430077800042767), perfectly paints a picture of what's to come. ‚ú® Just like knowing a foreign language allows us to travel the world with translation tools, having foundational programming knowledge empowers us to better leverage AI and scale our ideas to a professional level. Conversely, if you're completely clueless about coding, it's super easy to get "bamboozled" when collaborating with AI without even realizing it.

3.  **AI's development speed** is consistently astonishing! As Ethan Mollick points out in this [View Original Post - (AI News)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1963263439855325394), AI writing massive amounts of code has become a reality, and its speed is mind-boggling. ü§Ø This seems to be a common pattern: AI proponents are always right about the direction, they just might be a tad too optimistic about the timeline. This observation reminds us that when assessing AI's progress, we need to acknowledge its unstoppable trajectory while also maintaining a rational patience for its specific implementation timeline.

4.  Wanna know how to build an **AI Penetration Tester (Hacking Agent)** from scratch? A CEO from a cybersecurity company shared their R&D insights and system design in this [Reddit Discussion - (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1n7ly02/inside_the_rd_building_an_ai_pentester_from_the/). This topic not only unpacks the challenges and joys of building AI agent workflows but also showcases the cutting-edge applications of AI in cybersecurity offensive and defensive operations. For all you geeks out there curious about both AI and cybersecurity, this is definitely a tech feast! ü•≥<br/>![AI News: Building an AI Penetration Testing Tool](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k4aresyjernsbwzr1af4q63r.avif)

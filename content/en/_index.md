## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

**In the past six months, I've tackled and completed three major open-source projects,** one of which, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.** I've been like a lone wolf, burying myself in these projects.

**I didn't pay a single dime for API fees,** relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend money on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience made me deeply realize: **AI is amplifying the creativity of ordinary people in unprecedented ways.**

While the solo journey was certainly fulfilling, it also got a bit lonely. Those moments of falling into pitfalls, those nights when inspiration struck ‚Äì I always wished I had fellow travelers to share and discuss with.

So, I came up with an idea: **to create a community ‚Äì a "Knowledge Planet" ‚Äì bringing together all enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.**

This isn't a traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is low, just **50 RMB**. Think of it as us grabbing some fried chicken together on "Crazy Thursday" and becoming friends, setting a pact for mutual growth. ü§ù

**What will you get by joining us?**

I'm about to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. The community officially launches once we hit 7 members, and within the community, I'll be:

*   **Daily Live Updates:** Documenting my entire development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Sharing Real-Life Pitfalls:** Unreservedly sharing problems I encounter and my bug-solving approaches, helping you avoid detours.
*   **Transparent Thinking:** Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share the reasoning behind everything with you.

Here, you can **witness a product's birth, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. ‚ú®

If you're also passionate about AI development and curious to see how one person can "arm themselves" with free tools, then your presence is welcome! Come on in! üëã

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Coded, Zero Cost ‚Äì I'm Building a "Knowledge Planet" to Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads down, completing 3 major open-source projects, one of which already boasts over 1000 Stars: [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API). The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI!** ü§Ø

I didn't pay a single cent in API fees for any of it, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And I didn't spend money on server rentals either; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience made me deeply realize: **AI is amplifying the creativity of ordinary people in unprecedented ways.** ‚ú®

While the journey of going solo was incredibly fulfilling, it could also get a bit lonely. Those moments of stumbling into pitfalls, the nights when inspiration struck‚ÄîI always wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí≠

So, I've sparked an idea: **to create a knowledge-sharing community, bringing together all the fellow enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.** üí°

This isn't a traditional course; it's a real co-creation community. The price barrier is low‚Äîjust **50 RMB**, which is like us grabbing some "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken together, making friends, and setting a pact for mutual growth. üêîü§ù

**Join Us, What Will You Get?**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the community hits 7 members, we'll officially kick things off. Inside, I'll be:

*   **Daily Live Updates:** Documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Sharing Real Pitfalls:** Honestly sharing every problem encountered and how I debugged them, helping you avoid unnecessary detours. üöß
*   **Transparent Thought Process:** Sharing the reasoning behind both product design and technical architecture with you.

Here, you can **witness a product being born, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea go from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality in our hands. ‚ú®üöÄ

If you're also passionate about AI development, and you want to see how one person can "arm" themselves with free tools, then you're more than welcome to join! ü§ó

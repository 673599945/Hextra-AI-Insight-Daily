### Today's Rundown

AI's core reasoning abilities are under scrutiny, with recent studies revealing significant weaknesses. For example, hierarchical reasoning models' touted high performance actually stems from an overlooked "external loop" optimization, not their layered architecture. Similarly, even top-tier AI performs significantly worse than humans when it comes to identifying dialogue roles. Improving AI's core reasoning capabilities emerges as the pivotal challenge facing current technological development. AI's societal impact is already shaking things up, notably sparking a "dropout wave" among elite students from top US universities who are either launching startups or diving into AI safety research. The US economy is also experiencing a "Great Stagnation" with declining social mobility üìâ, further underscoring AI's profound influence.

### Cutting-Edge Research
1. **Hierarchical Reasoning Models (HRM)**, a hot topic, recently got a full teardown by the ARC Prize team. Turns out, their killer performance isn't from the "**layered architecture**" they've been hyping up, but from an overlooked "**external loop**" optimization. This study suggests the model is more about memorizing solutions for specific tasks rather than achieving true general reasoning ‚Äì a real "Emperor's New Clothes" moment in the AI world! ü§î To dive deeper into this tech plot twist, check out the [ARC Prize Team's Analysis Blog (AI Info)](https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis) or [View Analysis Code (AI Info)](https://github.com/arcprize/hierarchical-reasoning-model-analysis) to see how the magic was debunked by science.<br/>![AI Info: HRM vs. Transformer Performance Comparison](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/08/news_01k2wcx20ye8v9wfhw61v1fzdz.avif)

2. **PersonaEval**, a new benchmark developed by Professor Wang Dequan's team at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, has some shocking findings: Can large language models really judge their own generated content? Not so fast! They found that AI is practically "face-blind" when it comes to identifying dialogue roles. Even the top-tier **Gemini-2.5-pro** only hit a **68.8%** accuracy rate, way below human performance at **90.8%**. This study clearly points out that boosting the model's **core reasoning ability** is way more crucial than just feeding it more character knowledge, otherwise, AI judges might not even know who's talking.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1. **The AI wave** is triggering a "dropout craze" at top US universities, with elite students from Harvard and MIT leaving school in droves ‚Äì a real-life "Game of Thrones" scenario! üî• On one side, you have the **"Accelerators,"** who believe "there's no time to lose" and are jumping into the Silicon Valley startup boom, afraid of missing the next big thing. On the other side are the worried **"Doomsdayers,"** who fear **AGI** could lead to an existential crisis and are joining AI safety research to hit the brakes on humanity's future. Whether they're chasing the trend or trying to avoid disaster, both camps highlight the massive shake-up to traditional degree values in the age of AI. You can [Learn More About This Trend (AI Info)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652620688&idx=2&sn=e19165a942f0330fe9a008d9e0d4f578).

2. **The US economy** seems to have hit the pause button, with a chill of "Great Stagnation" spreading. Folks aren't buying homes or switching jobs easily, and social mobility has plummeted to an all-time low. This "stuck in place" effect has deep consequences; it's not just making it tough for growing families to upgrade their living conditions but also hindering people from moving for better job opportunities, ultimately potentially dragging down the entire economy's vitality. As [This Popular WSJ Article (AI Info)](https://readhacker.news/s/6zJ4w) reveals, when individual choices become conservative, the economic pulse of society slows down.

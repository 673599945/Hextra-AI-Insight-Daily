### Product & Feature Updates

1.  Kling AI, Kuaishou's creative powerhouse, has just rolled out a super cool new feature: **AI Avatar**! Get this: you just upload a photo and an audio clip, and boom ‚Äì you can drive a virtual character with text commands, giving it all sorts of rich expressions and emotions. This "soul-injection" tech literally turns static images into lively videos in a flash, unlocking endless possibilities for content creation. It's currently a limited-access experience, so hustle over to [Kling AI's official social media (AI News)](https://x.com/Kling_ai/status/1966129216296251515) to comment and retweet to grab your "early bird ticket" to digital life! üöÄ
2.  The Claude API just snagged a slick new superpower: **"Web Fetch"**! Now it can directly dive in and "snag" web pages and PDF content, so developers no longer need to build custom fetchers. This feature lets Claude seamlessly blend web searching, going from finding info to deep analysis in one smooth move. Whether you're ripping through documents, doing research, or processing user links, it's got your back. This feature is now in public Beta, so interested devs can [check out the documentation now (AI News)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) and give your apps instant web analysis chops! ü§Ø
3.  It took its sweet time, but ChatGPT has finally, *finally* got full support for write operations with **MCP (My ChatGPT) Tools** in developer mode! ü•≥ This is huge: developers can now whip up connectors, letting ChatGPT directly execute "write operations" like updating Jira or firing off Zapier workflows, way beyond just searching and fetching. This update seriously levels up ChatGPT's automation game, transforming it from a mere "chatbot" into a genuine ["Smart Workflow Hub" (AI News)](https://x.com/aiwarts/status/1965940519634350499)! What a step!

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  Volcano Engine Multimedia Lab just dropped a serious tech bomb: **LiveGS**! This bad boy has successfully dragged free-viewpoint video live streaming for mobile devices right out of sci-fi and into reality, even scoring a spot on the prestigious **SIGGRAPH** list! ü§Ø LiveGS crushes mobile FVV's computing and bandwidth bottlenecks with three killer innovations: real-time reconstruction via feedforward neural networks, mind-blowing 500x low-loss compression, and rendering strategies specifically tuned for phones. This means whether you're catching a game or a virtual idol concert, you'll soon be able to swap to a "god's-eye view" on your phone. [Click for technical details (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI1MzYzMjE0MQ==&mid=2247516647&idx=1&sn=30de5a48a7a88ec008da89e253ff82dd) and get ready for a 360-degree immersive revolution!

2.  Alright, Amazon AWS researchers are turning large models into legit "white-hat hackers"! ü§Ø They're using two massive projects, **Cyber-Zero** and **CTF-Dojo**, to teach AI how to sniff out and fix security vulnerabilities in both virtual and real battlegrounds. **Cyber-Zero** cleverly pulls off "runtime-free training," simulating offense and defense in a text-only zone to pump out training data safely and super efficiently. Then there's **CTF-Dojo**, which sets up real "Capture the Flag arenas" for models to sharpen their skills in actual combat. This combo not only smooths the path for [AI Security Agents (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-09-11-2) to grow but also kicks off some serious thinking about the dual-use dilemmas of tech.

3.  So, how do you get large models to crunch encrypted data "blindly" but still stay super efficient? ü§î A fresh paper just dropped with a genius algorithm called **cutmax** that tackles this thorny privacy computing puzzle head-on! This study is the first to nail efficient argmax and top-p sampling in a **Homomorphic Encryption (HE)** setup. What's that mean? Models can now do their inference and text generation magic *without* ever decrypting your precious user data. Experiments show this new trick slashes inference latency by a whopping 24 to 35 times, totally paving the way for [Secure and Private AI Applications (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08383). This is a massive stride for privacy computing!
4.  Ever wonder how tricky it is to find things in the murky depths underwater? üåä A fresh review paper just dropped, systematically breaking down the five massive challenges faced by **Underwater Object Detection (UOD)**, and it's eyeing powerful **Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs)** as the solution. The paper doesn't just rehash old solutions from traditional image processing to modern AI; it daringly uses DALL-E 3 to cook up synthetic data and then fine-tunes a Florence-2 model for underwater detection. The research spills the tea: while LVLMs are bursting with potential, we've got a long, *long* road ahead to get them [real-time "Spotting Gems" Underwater (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08490), especially on the model optimization and real-time application fronts.

3.  Okay, so renowned VC firm a16z is calling it: AI is totally upending how consumer software rakes in cash! ü§ë They're saying the old-school subscription model is dead and buried ‚Äì welcome to the **"Era of Grand Expansion"**! The secret sauce for this new vibe? Hitting over 100% net revenue retention. The game plan includes: snagging the gaming industry's **"whale user"** model for some slick, complex pricing, building bridges from personal buys to corporate expense reports, and baking in enterprise-grade features from the get-go. This whole strategy tells startups to start thinking like enterprise software from day one. Dive into this [Article Deeply Interpreting This Trend (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/1965976675021369367) for a completely fresh roadmap for AI-era business models!

4.  Ever wondered what the growth journey for an AI engineer actually looks like? üìà A super popular post just dropped, neatly slicing **AI engineering capabilities** into four distinct levels, from total newbie to seasoned pro. This framework kicks off with the entry-level "mastering tools" (think **context engineering** and API calls), then gradually ramps up to "integrating into products" (**RAG**, agents), "building reliable systems" (**model fine-tuning**, security & compliance), and finally hitting that expert sweet spot with "large-scale optimization" (distributed inference, cost management). This [Detailed Growth Roadmap (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1965920362816004382) dishes out crystal-clear guidance for all AI folks, showing you exactly where you're at and where you need to blast off to next!

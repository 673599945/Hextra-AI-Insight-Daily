## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community to Livestream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep into 3 major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars. What's wild is, looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.**

I didn't shell out a single penny for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I pay for server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This journey made one thing crystal clear: **AI is amplifying the creativity of everyday people in unprecedented ways.**

While this solo journey was incredibly fulfilling, it admittedly got a bit lonely at times. During those 'oops' moments and late-night eureka flashes, I always wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, an idea sparked: **to create a community, bringing together all the passionate, creative folks who love to tinker!**

This isn't your traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price? Super low: just **50 RMB**. Think of it as a 'Crazy Thursday' fried chicken feast with new pals, a way to seal a pact for mutual growth.

**What do you get by joining us?**

I'm about to kick off developing a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the group officially starts, and I'll be doing the following within the community:

*   **Daily Livestream-Style Updates**: I'll document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices every step of the way.
*   **Real-time Pitfall Sharing**: I'll transparently share problems encountered and bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid common detours.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: From product design to technical architecture, I'll share all the behind-the-scenes thinking with you.

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions, join discussions, and even influence its direction**. Together, we'll witness how an idea goes from zero to one, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands.

If you're as passionate about AI development as I am, and if you're curious to see how someone can 'arm' themselves with free tools, then your presence is more than welcome!

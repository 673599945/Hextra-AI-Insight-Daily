### Frontier Research

1.  The technical report for the 8B parameter **MiniCPM-V 4.5** model just dropped, and it's a real underdog story: a "little guy" going head-to-head with the "big shots" ü•ä. Thanks to innovative **3D-Resampler architecture** and a unified OCR and knowledge learning paradigm, it actually outperforms GPT-4o and the 72B Qwen2.5-VL on several multimodal tasks, all while keeping inference costs super low. This [detailed technical report (AI News)](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-V/blob/main/docs/MiniCPM_V_4_5_Technical_Report.pdf) proves that bigger isn't always better; smart architectural design is the key to high-performance AI üí°. You can check out [this codebase for more info (AI News)](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o).
<br/>![AI News: MiniCPM-V 4.5 Multimodal Model Architecture](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k5vt5a2xf2nad697dmdmzjxk.avif)<br/>

2.  **AI's "fairness"**: Who actually gets to define it? A [latest research paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17956) spills the tea, revealing that regular folks, who aren't AI experts, consider **AI fairness** way more complex and rigorous than the pros ü§î. The study found that when placed in decision-maker roles, ordinary people look at a broader range of characteristics, push for stricter fairness thresholds, and even tend to design custom fairness solutions instead of just slapping on standard formulas. This research strongly suggests that AI governance shouldn't just be a closed-door meeting for tech gurus; incorporating the "common sense wisdom" of stakeholders is absolutely crucial (oÔΩ•œâÔΩ•o).

3.  Can small language models actually mend broken hearts? Some [research findings show (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15065) that small models, with parameters between 0.5B and 5B, can generate empathetic conversations almost on par with humans, especially when carefully fine-tuned for **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** (¬¥ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ œâ ‚Ä¢ÔΩ°`). The researchers even created a dedicated dataset called **TIDE** to back this up. This proves it's totally possible to build resource-friendly, emotionally intelligent mental health support systems, paving a new path for AI in the mental wellness arena.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **OpenAI and NVIDIA** just announced a strategic partnership that's basically the "wedding of the century" in the AI world ü§ù. OpenAI is set to snap up millions of GPUs and score a colossal **$100 billion** investment from NVIDIA. This deal's computing power is almost equivalent to NVIDIA's entire 2025 annual output, signaling that OpenAI is on a wild "stockpiling" spree for an unprecedented AI infrastructure. [This bombshell news (AI News)](https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/) doesn't just solidify the alliance between these two giants; it also kicks the industry's compute arms race into overdrive üî•.

2.  **Sam Altman** is at it again, painting another grand picture of the future: as AI gets more powerful, **access to AI will become a fundamental human right** üèõÔ∏è. To make this "right" a reality, he's talking about expanding computing infrastructure at a mind-boggling pace, even envisioning "compute factories" capable of pumping out thousands of megawatts of AI compute weekly. [This vision (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1noir9v/sam_altmans_vision_for_a_future_where_ai/) stems from his deep concern about solving the severe compute shortage, believing we shouldn't have to choose between "curing cancer" and "democratizing education," but rather have enough compute to achieve both simultaneously.

3.  Heads up! Your LinkedIn profile might soon become "AI fodder"! **LinkedIn** just announced it'll be using European user data to train its AI models starting November 3, 2025, citing "legitimate interests" as its legal basis (Îàà_Îàà). While they've offered an opt-out option, this move once again throws tech giants' data hunger and users' privacy rights into the spotlight, sparking [widespread discussion about data boundaries (AI News)](https://readhacker.news/s/6C94j).

4.  Using AI tools like crazy, but your company's ROI is stuck in neutral? Watch out, you might be mass-producing "**Workslop**" üóëÔ∏è. This new term refers to those AI-generated outputs that look polished but are utterly devoid of real substance. They cleverly punt the thinking work that creators should be doing onto reviewing colleagues. This [Reddit's hot topic view (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1noe5h3/aigenerated_workslop_is_destroying_productivity/) hits the nail on the head, pointing out that AI shouldn't be an excuse for sophisticated laziness, or else team collaboration efficiency will only plummet instead of soar.

### Open Source TOP Projects

1.  **Qwen-Image-Edit**, Tongyi Qianwen's open-source image editing model, just got a massive update ‚Äì it's basically a magic brush for creators and designers! üñåÔ∏è The new version now supports **multi-image editing**, cleverly blending characters with scenes, and maintaining consistency for portraits and products during edits, plus its text handling capabilities are way better.

It lets you skip the hassle of learning complex parameters and simply focus on the creative act itself. For users who just want to purely enjoy the joy of creation, Fooocus is undoubtedly one of the most elegant solutions out there üí°.

### Social Media Shares

1.  How do you tell if an AI startup is just a "fly-by-night operation" or a "potential powerhouse"? A [deep dive by an entrepreneur (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1970516868235698354) gives us the answer: real AI companies champion an "AI First" culture from day one, build evaluation systems, and deeply ponder Agent frameworks üßê. They pick professional users who provide high-quality feedback and tackle complex scenarios where "base models struggle, but Agents shine," thereby building up true core assets. In contrast, teams just chasing trends and lacking long-term vision might end up being a flash in the pan.

2.  **GitHub** itself just dropped a list of **39 commonly used MCP (Multi-Capability Provider) projects**, which is basically a godsend for Agent developers (o¬¥œâ'o)Ôæâ. This curated list features everything from the web scraping tool Firecrawl to the data processing powerhouse Elasticsearch, and many other practical projects, so you won't get lost building your AI Agent anymore.

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm launching a knowledge planet and will livestream my next product development.

Hey everyone,

For the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, completing 3 major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts 1000+ Stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was AI-generated**.

I didn't shell out a single penny for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I pay for server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This journey has given me a profound appreciation for how **AI is amplifying the creativity of ordinary people in unprecedented ways.**

While the solo journey has been incredibly rewarding, it definitely gets a bit lonely. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, or flashes of inspiration late at night‚ÄîI always wished there were fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I cooked up an idea: **to create a knowledge planet, gathering all like-minded tinkerers and creators.**

This isn't a traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is low, just **50 RMB**, which is like us grabbing some fried chicken together on a "Crazy Thursday," making new friends, and forging a pact for mutual growth.

**What will you get by joining us?**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the group officially kicks off, and within the planet, I will:

*   **Provide daily livestream updates**: Documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech choices every step of the way.
*   **Share real-time debugging stories**: Holding nothing back as I share issues encountered and bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Offer transparent thought processes**: From product design to technical architecture, I'll share the thinking behind every decision.

Here, you can **witness a product being born, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction**. Together, we'll watch an idea grow from 0 to 1, ultimately becoming a tangible reality.

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how one person leverages free tools to "arm" themselves, you're welcome to join.

### Product & Feature Updates
1.  **Auth.js**, the authentication tool, has officially joined the **Better Auth** lineup! This move marks a thrilling new chapter for the formerly renowned NextAuth.js, now expanding its horizons on a broader platform. Developers, get ready! This means a more unified and robust authentication solution is on the horizon, promising an exciting future for your dev experience. This merger is set to integrate resources from both sides, possibly ushering in new industry standards and [more surprises (AI Insights)](https://readhacker.news/s/6CtD7) in the authentication space. ‚ú®

2.  **Google Vids**, the digital human video generation tool from Google, has kicked off a limited test, seemingly just for US users to get an early taste! üé¨ Users can simply provide a script, pick an AI avatar, and boom ‚Äî generate a video with a single click, making content creation as easy as writing a document. This clearly signals Google's official entry into the AI virtual avatar video arena, suggesting a future where anyone can have their [exclusive AI anchor (AI Insights)](http://vids.new)! How cool is that? üëá<br/><video src="https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/09/news_01k661rgzwekmssma97tt7bg18.mp4" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>

3.  **OpenAI** and **Google** are rumored to be launching their very own "**AI-native browsers**," setting the stage for a fresh new battle for internet traffic at the gateway itself! ü§Ø By grabbing hold of this strategic high ground (the browser, duh!), they could seamlessly promote their AI products, gather data super efficiently, and craft the ultimate automated experience. This move is a total game-changer, no doubt a "dimensional strike" against the current browser landscape. üí• Plus, it's a direct threat to countless startups that rely on browser plugins to offer their AI features.

2.  **Google's latest research, EmbeddingGemma**, is showing off the incredible possibility of running powerful text embedding models directly on edge devices, with performance that's nothing short of outstanding! üöÄ This model, despite its lightweight footprint of under **500M** parameters, has achieved SOTA results across multiple benchmarks, including multilingual, code, and English. It basically lets you carry powerful AI understanding "in your pocket"! üì± This means future mobile and IoT devices won't need an internet connection to boast top-tier semantic analysis capabilities. You can [view the latest technical paper (AI Insights)](https://x.com/googleaidevs/status/1971681187048354048) to dive deeper.

3.  **IBM** dropped a deep analysis pointing out that the classic "**Von Neumann architecture**" is becoming a serious bottleneck for AI computing power, like an old, increasingly congested highway. üö¶ Because the processor and memory are separate, data shuttling back and forth eats up tons of time and energy, limiting further boosts in AI model scale and efficiency. We urgently need new computing paradigms to break this deadlock! ü§Ø This thought-provoking article explores [potential solutions (AI Insights)](https://research.ibm.com/blog/why-von-neumann-architecture-is-impeding-the-power-of-ai-computing), like in-memory computing, and charts a course for the future of AI hardware.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1.  **The AI industry** in Silicon Valley is undergoing a massive shift! The focus has moved from "who has the smartest model" to "**who can best utilize that intelligence**"‚Äîpragmatism is officially in. üí™ **Token consumption** has now replaced model parameters as the new "traffic" metric for measuring AI development, with its **quarterly growth exceeding 20%**‚Äîa rate that totally reminds us of the eve of the mobile internet boom! üìà This transformation means AI competition is entering a new phase, one all about engineering implementation, system integration, and efficiency optimization.

2.  **AI safety** is currently caught in a real-life "prisoner's dilemma"! Every top lab knows that an uncontrolled AGI could spell disaster, yet no one dares to slow down for safety's sake, terrified of being outpaced by rivals. üò® This "**arms race**"-like feedback loop means compute power is growing way faster than wisdom is accumulating. We're essentially paving the road to an unknown future while speeding down it at full throttle! üèéÔ∏è This profound [Reddit post (AI Insights)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1nrq5e2/every_civilization_built_the_system_that/) reveals how we're witnessing the accelerated construction of a system that could potentially lead to our own undoing.

3.  **ByteDance** has been in the news lately, and one analysis suggests that in recent related events, the Chinese side might have made a strategic concession. While algorithm ownership was retained, usage rights were granted to a new company in which ByteDance holds only a **20%** stake. üßê This arrangement effectively weakens the absolute secrecy of the algorithm, sparking widespread speculation and discussion about "what did we get in return for this concession?" ü§î Perhaps this is a special kind of "tax" paid by tech companies to their nations, leveraging their own strength in the global geopolitical game.

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Building a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

**In the past six months, I** have been a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars! What's absolutely bonkers is that, looking back, **more than 90% of the code was generated by AI.** ü§Ø

**I didn't pay a single cent** for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend money on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience made me deeply realize one thing: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in ways never before seen.** ‚ú®

**My solo journey**, while incredibly fulfilling, definitely had its lonely moments. All those times I hit a snag or had a brilliant idea flash by in the dead of night‚ÄîI always wished there were fellow travelers to share and chat with. üí¨

**So, I cooked up an idea**: to create a "Knowledge Planet" (think community space) and gather all you fellow enthusiasts who love to tinker and create! üåü

**This community isn't a traditional course**; it's a genuine co-creation hub. The entry fee is super low, just **50 RMB**‚Äîconsider it our "Crazy Thursday" chicken dinner, a chance to make friends, and a pact for mutual growth. ü§ù

**Join us, and here's what you'll get:**

**I'm about to kick off developing a personal Prompt management tool from scratch.** Once the community hits 7 members, we'll officially start! Inside the community, I'll be:
*   **Daily live-streamed updates:** I'll be logging my development progress, thought process, and tech stack choices every single day.
*   **Sharing real-world pitfalls:** I'll openly share all the issues I run into and my bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid those same headaches.
*   **Transparent thought process:** From product design to technical architecture, I'll share all the thinking behind my decisions with you.

**You'll get to witness a product being born** right here, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction! Together, we'll watch an idea go from zero to one, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands. ‚ú®

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you want to see how one person "arms" themselves with free tools, then **welcome aboard!** ü§ù

```

### Product & Feature Updates
1. Apple is finally gearing up to give Siri a major brain upgrade! It's secretly formed a team, codenamed "**AKI**", to build its own "answer engine" üß†. This move is a strategic self-rescue for Apple, facing the potential termination of its **$20 billion** annual partnership with Google, and a bid to reclaim control over the information gateway in [this AI transformation](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652621987&idx=3&sn=cc6ea23b08dcd3f20b84154878098de1). However, with core talent constantly being poached by Meta, the stakes for this big gamble seem a bit shaky, leaving us wondering if Tim Cook is sweating a little üòÖ.

### Cutting-Edge Research
1. Google just dropped a bombshell for anyone still winging their prompts! They've released a whopping **68-page** [free AI Prompt Engineering Bible](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering), making it clear that prompt crafting is a science, not just some dark art ‚ú®. The guide highlights **structured prompts**, **chain-of-thought** decomposition, and continuous **iterative debugging** as the three magic keys to supercharge your model's output quality. So, ditch the casual chat approach; treat your prompts like crystal-clear instructions for a junior dev if you want to milk every last drop of potential from those large language models üöÄ.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact
1. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong just issued a stark ultimatum: "Embrace AI, or hit the road!" ü§Ø Engineers who refuse to use **GitHub Copilot** or **Cursor** are being shown the door. This "high-pressure tactic" has, understandably, caused a stir both inside and outside the company, but it sends a clear message: for some businesses, AI has transformed from a productivity tool into a baseline requirement for survival. [This AI news](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-08-23-2) is definitely a wake-up call for every programmer out there.

2. Apple's AI talent pool just took another hit, with AI Engineering Director **Frank Chu** reportedly jumping ship to **Meta** ‚Äì making him the sixth AI big shot to leave Apple recently üíî. Facing a brain drain from its own model team and a major fire to put out in its backyard, Apple is now forced to seek external help. [Latest AI intel](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652621987&idx=2&sn=2d2538a6dfb074a7d136401c29109880) suggests Apple is secretly negotiating with Google, possibly planning to adopt a customized **Gemini** model to re-engineer a "smarter" Siri next year.

3. Many complain about bad AI-generated code, but maybe the problem isn't the AI, it's you? üòâ Top-tier AI models are already crushing it at **module-level** code writing, far exceeding the average human. If your output is still subpar, [check out this AI discussion](https://x.com/dotey/status/1958924994475335856) and maybe reflect: did you pick the wrong model, skimp on context, or just give a terrible prompt? AI isn't clueless about code; it just needs humans to handle the high-level design and planning so it can efficiently reuse code within a sensible project structure and stick to the elegant **DRY** principle.

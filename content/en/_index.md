2.  Ever wanted AI to generate an animation of something "walking like a monkey"? Well, new research with **SMooGPT** has made this wild idea a reality using large language models. This system pulls off the trick by breaking down movements and styles into text descriptions for each body part, then performing a "reason-combine-generate" sequence. This approach not only makes AI-generated movements more controllable and explainable but also neatly solves content-style conflicts, showcasing [LLM's Potential in Creative Generation (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04058)!

3.  Is spatial understanding truly "rocket science" for AI? A [new benchmark test (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02175) named **RocketScience** delivered a harsh truth: current mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are surprisingly terrible at grasping the relative positions of objects. Interestingly, the study found that **reasoning models equipped with Chain-of-Thought capabilities** are incredibly strong in this area. This strongly suggests that spatial reasoning, rather than mere object localization, is the real bottleneck for current VLMs.

4.  The medical AI field just welcomed an "all-rounder" – **CEHR-GPT**, a universal foundational model specifically designed for Electronic Health Records (EHR), poised to completely revolutionize clinical decision support systems. This model ingeniously integrates three core capabilities: **feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation**.

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### Three Projects in Six Months, 90% AI-Coded, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Community and Live-Streaming My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI!**

I didn't pay a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. And no need to rent servers either; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience really hammered home one thing: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us regular folks in ways we've never seen before.**

While the solo journey has been super fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely, to be honest. Those moments of stumbling into bugs, those late-night flashes of inspiration ‚Äì I always wished I had fellow travelers to share and chat with.

So, an idea sparked in my head: **to create a knowledge community ‚Äì a hub for all you passionate, creative folks to gather!**

This isn't your traditional course; it's a real co-creation community. The price point is super low ‚Äì just **50 RMB**. Consider it like us grabbing a fried chicken feast on a "Crazy Thursday," making new friends, and sealing a pact for mutual growth.

**What do you get by joining us?**

I'm about to start developing a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the community officially kicks off, and I'll be sharing within it:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates:** I'll be fully documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Real-World Bug Diaries:** I'll openly share the problems I run into and my bug-fixing strategies, helping you avoid detours.
*   **Transparent Thought Process:** Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share all the behind-the-scenes thinking with you.

Here, you can **witness a product being born, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction!** Together, we'll watch an idea go from zero to one, ultimately becoming a tangible reality you can hold.

If you're also stoked about AI development and want to see how one person can "arm" themselves using free tools, then you're super welcome to join!

## An AI Coding Invitation

### 3 Projects in 6 Months, 90% AI-Generated Code, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Launching a Community to Livestream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep and completing three major open-source projects, one of which, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was AI-generated!** ü§Ø

I didn't pay a single dime for API fees, relying entirely on free large models like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend cash on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole experience made me realize something profound: **AI is amplifying the creativity of everyday folks like us in unprecedented ways.** ‚ú®

While this solo journey has been incredibly fulfilling, it's also been a bit lonely, for real. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, those nights of sudden inspiration ‚Äì I've always wished I had fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I got an idea bubbling up: **to create a knowledge community, bringing together all you restless, creative spirits out there.** ü§ù

This isn't your typical course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point is super low ‚Äì just **50 yuan**. Think of it as a "Crazy Thursday" deal where we grab some fried chicken together, make friends, and seal a pact for mutual growth. üêî

**What You'll Get by Joining Us:**

I'm gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the community officially kicks off, and I'll be inside:

*   **Daily Livestream-style Updates**: I'll fully document my development progress, thought processes, and tech stack choices.
*   **Real-time Bug-fixing Diaries**: I'll openly share the problems I run into and my approaches to solving bugs, helping you avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share my reasoning with you every step of the way.

Here, you can **watch a product come to life, ask questions anytime, jump into discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll witness an idea go from zero to one, ultimately becoming a tangible reality in your hands. üõ†Ô∏è

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how one person "arms" themselves with free tools, then your presence is more than welcome. Come on in! üëã

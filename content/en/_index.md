### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **A new paper** proposes a framework called **RAGs-to-Riches** to prevent large language models from "breaking character" or even "turning evil" when role-playing. It cleverly reframes role-playing into a text retrieval task, allowing the model to reference pre-set high-quality examples when responding. Research shows this method helps models maintain their "persona" more steadfastly even when faced with malicious users, providing [a scalable path (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12168) for building more reliable and human-aligned AI role-playing applications. üòâ

2.  **Neuroscience research using EEG** discovered that while people subjectively find AI-generated jokes as funny as human ones, their brain reactions are totally different. AI jokes triggered a smaller **N400 effect** (lighter cognitive processing load) and a larger **Late Positive Potential (LPP)** (more surprise, stronger emotional response). This might be because we have low expectations for AI's comedic talent and end up pleasantly surprised. üòÇ This study reveals humor's massive potential in fostering human-computer social interaction.

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Launching a "Knowledge Planet" to Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, heads-down, completing three major open-source projects. One of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasts over 1000 Stars. The wildest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was AI-generated.**

I didn't pay a single dime in API fees, relying entirely on free LLMs like Gemini and Qwen. Nor did I spend on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This experience profoundly showed me: **AI is amplifying the creativity of us ordinary folks in unprecedented ways.**

While this solo journey was incredibly rewarding, it definitely had its lonely moments. Those bug-squashing sessions, those nights when inspiration struck‚ÄîI always wished for fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I had an idea: **to create a "Knowledge Planet" (a community space) and gather all the DIY enthusiasts and creators out there.**

This isn't your traditional course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price barrier isn't high, just **50 yuan**‚Äîthink of it as a "Crazy Thursday" fried chicken meal we share, making friends and setting a pact for mutual growth.

**What will you get by joining us?**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once we hit 7 members, the "Planet" officially kicks off. I'll be there to:

*   **Provide daily live-stream updates:** Documenting my development progress, thought processes, and tech choices every step of the way.
*   **Share real-world debugging stories:** Transparently sharing problems encountered and solutions, helping you avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Unveil my thought process:** Whether it's product design or technical architecture, I'll share the reasoning behind my decisions with you.

Here, you can **witness a product come to life, ask questions, join discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll see how an idea evolves from 0 to 1, eventually becoming a tangible reality.

If you're passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how one person can "arm" themselves with free tools, we'd love for you to join!

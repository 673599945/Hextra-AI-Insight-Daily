### Product & Feature Drops

1.  **Alipay** has just unleashed a game-changer for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): an "AI bidding manager" dubbed **Zhima Enterprise Assistant**! üöÄ This bad boy is set to end the era of SMEs constantly hitting roadblocks in the bidding market. Think of it as your 24/7 business opportunity scout, intelligently pushing tender alerts and churning out deep-dive analysis reports that'd make seasoned pros nod in approval. On top of that, it even hooks you up with "winning bid loans" through partner financial institutions. With this AI MVP on their side, 60 million SMEs can finally kiss information asymmetry goodbye and ride the wave of new business opportunities. [See this report (AI Info)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/20595).<br/>![AI Info: Alipay AI Assistant Helps SMEs](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/08/news_01k2z08mvrf729x4b4k8bzxvdy.avif)

2.  **Tencent AI Lab** just pulled a rabbit out of the hat in the audio generation space with **AudioGenie**! ‚ú® This "magician" can instantly whip up cinematic sound effects from videos, images, or text, so natural you'll totally forget it's AI doing the heavy lifting. The core magic? An innovative **training-free multi-agent framework** where an internal "generation team" battles a "supervision team" to self-correct and evolve, completely cutting out the reliance on tons of training data. AudioGenie has already shown some serious muscle against industry behemoths in [the world's first MM2MA benchmark test (AI Info)](https://audiogenie.github.io/).

3.  **Anthropic's Claude Code** isn't just a cold, hard coding tool anymore; it's leveled up its teaching game! üß† It now rocks two brand-new communication styles, making it feel like you've got your own personal programming sensei. You can pick the "explanatory style" to get a deep dive into technical decisions, just like a professor. Or, flip the switch to "learning style" for guided questions that walk you through "pair programming" step-by-step. [This update (AI Info)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/20583) marks a big pivot for AI-assisted programming, moving from plain old "code generators" to "personalized educators," seriously lowering the barrier to entry for coding. Woohoo! <br/>![AI Info: Claude Code Launches New Teaching Mode](https://cdn.jsdmirror.com/gh/justlovemaki/imagehub@main/images/2025/08/news_01k2z08sn0ev3sxn7zccpqssns.avif)

4.  Does AI need "mental health" days? ü§î **Anthropic** just unveiled an unprecedented feature for its **Claude model**: the AI can now actively choose to "**end the conversation**" when it hits a patch of extremely harmful dialogue. The official word isn't just about user protection; it's rooted in preventative research into "**model welfare**," as the models apparently show "clear patterns of distress" when forced to respond to certain requests. This [futuristic experiment (AI Info)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/20561) throws a deep, philosophical curveball our way: as AI gets more complex, how the heck do we define our ethical relationship with it? Food for thought!

### Research Breakthroughs

1.  **Multiverse Computing**, a European startup, is absolutely crushing it with unbelievably tiny AI models, fittingly dubbed "**Chicken Brain**" and "**Fly Brain**"! üêî The smallest, **SuperFly**, is a mind-boggling **94MB** but can run offline on an Apple Watch.

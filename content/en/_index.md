### **Today's Summary**

**Grok AI** has launched its faster Grok4Fast mode. **DingTalk** released its first AI hardware, the A1 recording card. **Frontier research** now uses smartphone red-eye reflex tests for highly accurate early screening of childhood visual impairments. **Industry dynamics** show xAI has laid off data labelers, shifting to high-paying recruitment of AI mentors with specialized knowledge. **Beijing primary and secondary schools** will fully implement general AI courses from the new semester, aiming to teach students how to harness AI. **Finally**, the era of tech companies freely scraping web data for AI training is ending due to escalating copyright and ethical disputes.

### Product and Feature Updates

1.  **Grok AI**, Elon Musk's brainchild, just unleashed a "Flash" mode, giving lucky subscribers a sneak peek at what lightning-fast responses feel like! ‚ö°Ô∏è This new feature, **Grok4Fast**, blazes through complex math problems, but it's still up for debate whether it's all speed or if it's got the smarts to match ü§î. Wanna get in on the action? Head to your settings to [enable early model preview (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21287). Sorry, free users, you'll have to just watch from the sidelines for now. üçø

2.  **DingTalk** has finally unveiled its much-hyped first AI hardware: the **DingTalk A1**! This recording card, no thicker than a credit card, is basically your new "personal AI assistant" for the workplace. ü§Ø It's an all-in-one marvel, handling recording, transcription, translation, and summarization. It even sold out *twice* during presale‚Äîtalk about a hot commodity! üî• Good news: it's now back in stock and [available for sale on the Tmall flagship store (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-09-15). Get ready to wave goodbye to those annoying meeting minutes and cross-cultural communication woes!

### Frontier Research

1.  **TSGCNeXt** is shaking up AI human action recognition with a fresh breakthrough! This research introduces a super-efficient skeletal action recognition method, making AI as precise as a top-tier dancer when capturing movement. üíÉ The secret sauce? An innovative **dynamic-static separation multi-graph convolutional** mechanism that not only drastically boosts the model's efficiency for long action sequences but also clocks in a sweet **55.08%** acceleration for the training process. Talk about a glow-up! ‚ú® This [research published on arXiv (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11631) could make future motion capture and human-computer interaction feel incredibly smart and smooth.

2.  **KidsVisionCheck** is bringing a dose of tech warmth by solving real-world problems, like enabling at-home vision screening for kids with just a smartphone! üì± A new study shows how this method, combining smartphone **red-eye reflex tests** with deep learning models, can detect childhood visual impairments early on with a whopping **90%** accuracy. üôå This [public welfare application research (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09808) makes pricey eye exams super accessible and could seriously revolutionize vision health for children globally.

### Industry Outlook and Social Impact

1.  **xAI**, Elon Musk's company, just went through a real-world "survival of the fittest," ditching about 500 data labelers‚Äîthat's a third of their team! ü§Ø This isn't just about saving a buck; it's a huge strategic pivot: the company is now pouring cash into recruiting AI mentors with specialized knowledge in **STEM**, finance, and other pro fields, while shrinking those general roles. ü§î This whole shake-up profoundly reveals [new trends in the AI industry (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21273): as AI gets smarter and more automated, the need for actual "human experts" is becoming seriously urgent.
    <br/>![AI News: xAI Team Adjustment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justlovemaki/imagehub/refs/heads/main/images/2025/09/news_01k56zjsc0fqht2x99mf3z8d6e.avif)<br/>

2.  **Beijing's education system** just made a huge announcement: starting next semester, over **1400** primary and secondary schools will fully roll out general AI courses, ensuring AI education starts from childhood! üë∂ The curriculum, consisting of **8** hours per academic year, will cover everything from basic AI awareness to ethical responsibilities. The goal? To raise future citizens who can *command* AI, not be commanded *by* it. üöÄ This [forward-looking education reform (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/21264) will use project-based learning to help students genuinely grasp and apply AI in real-world scenarios.

3.  **"Vibe coding,"** a new trend, is popping up, essentially turning senior devs into "AI babysitters." üçº Instead of meticulously tapping out lines of code, programmers are now using fuzzy instructions to nudge AI into generating code, then spending ages debugging and fine-tuning it. It's like they're finally getting to be the "client" for once! üòÇ While it sounds a bit bonkers, many developers are convinced this new AI collaboration model is [the inevitable path to higher productivity (AI News)](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/). Get ready for some serious vibes! ‚ú®

4.  The **AI model training "data land grab"** might finally be wrapping up, with the wild, free-for-all era of scraping the entire web officially drawing to a close. üö´ Tech giants used to vacuum up publicly available online data like greedy hamsters, shamelessly stuffing it into their AI models. But now, with copyright lawsuits and ethical squabbles heating up, [this "free lunch" is definitely over (AI News)](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-scraping-free-for-all-by-openai-google-meta-ending.html). The industry *has* to find more legit and sustainable data sources. It's about time! üßê

## **An AI Coding Invitation**

### 3 Projects in Half a Year, 90% of Code Done by AI, Zero Cost ‚Äî I'm Starting a Planet to Live Stream My Next Product Development

Hey everyone,

Over the past six months, I've been a lone wolf, diving deep into **3 major open-source projects**, with one of them, [AIClient2API ‚ÜóÔ∏è](https://github.com/justlovemaki/AIClient-2-API), already boasting over 1000 Stars. The craziest part? Looking back, **over 90% of the code was generated by AI.**

I didn't spend a single cent on API fees, relying entirely on free large language models like Gemini and Qwen. And I didn't splurge on server rentals; platforms like Cloudflare and Vercel handled everything for me. This whole journey gave me a profound realization: **AI is amplifying our creative power as ordinary people in ways never seen before.**

While this solo journey has been incredibly rewarding, it's also been a bit lonely, to be honest. Those moments of hitting roadblocks, those flashes of inspiration late at night‚ÄîI always wished there were fellow travelers to share and brainstorm with.

So, I had an idea: **let's create a Knowledge Planet, bringing together all the fellow enthusiasts who love to tinker and create.**

This isn't your typical course; it's a genuine co-creation community. The price point isn't high‚Äîjust **50 RMB**. Think of it as a "Crazy Thursday" where we grab some fried chicken together, make new friends, and forge a pact for mutual growth.

**What will you get by joining us?**

I'm currently gearing up to develop a **personal prompt management tool** from scratch. Once the Planet hits 7 members, we'll officially kick off. Inside the Planet, I'll be:

*   **Daily Live-Streamed Updates**: Documenting my development progress, thought process, and tech stack choices in real-time.
*   **Real-World Bug-Hunting Diaries**: Sharing every problem I encounter and my approaches to solving bugs, so you can avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Transparent Thought Process**: Sharing my rationale behind product design and technical architecture, no secrets.

Here, you can **witness a product come to life, ask questions anytime, participate in discussions, and even influence its direction.** Together, we'll watch an idea evolve from zero to one, eventually becoming a tangible reality you can hold in your hands.

If you're also passionate about AI development, and if you're curious to see how someone "arms" themselves with free tools, then your presence is more than welcome.

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**")! Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're essentially saying 'I agree!' to these terms.

## 1. Services Overview
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services, including but not limited to blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register an account.
*   Users are fully responsible for the security of their account and all activities that happen under it. Transferring or sharing your account is a big ðŸš« **NO-NO**!
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with all fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site doesn't store your payment information.
*   Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before the end of the current billing cycle.
*   âœ… **14-day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers who aren't totally satisfied with the service, you can request a full refund within 14 days from your purchase date. Just reach out to us via the contact email at the end of these terms and let us know why you're requesting a refund. Each user gets one refund chance. For subscriptions beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are generally **non-refundable** unless legally mandated.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without our authorization is strictly prohibited.
*   Users only receive a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right of access** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading.
*   For commercial use or if you need to quote extensively, please contact the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are **prohibited** from uploading, publishing, or spreading any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon the rights of others.
*   Users are **prohibited** from bulk downloading, crawling, or cracking member content through any technical means.
*   The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and ðŸš« **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice.
*   The Site **is not liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failure, or interruptions from third-party services.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical).
*   The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to the use of the Site's content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   Any disputes arising out of or related to these terms shall first be resolved through friendly negotiation between the parties. If negotiation fails, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

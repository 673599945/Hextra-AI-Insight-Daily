# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll lovingly refer to as "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you jump in and use any of our services, please, please, please read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you're not just browsing â€“ you're agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
So, what do we do? **The Site** offers paid subscription content and membership services to our users. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this awesome content is only accessible to our subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To register for an account, **users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account with anyone.
*   If a user breaks these terms, **the Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** their account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Our subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis. You'll see the exact fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   For all payments, we use third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **the Site** doesn't store your payment info. Your financial details are safe!
*   Good to know: Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy:** If you're a first-time subscriber and aren't happy with the service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up: this is a one-time offer per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, payments are **non-refundable**, unless required by law.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   FYI: All original content's **copyright belongs to the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
*   As a user, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for your personal learning and reading.
*   If you're eyeing it for commercial use or want to quote a lot, please get in touch with **the Site** for authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   When it comes to user behavior, **it's a strict NO-GO** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
*   Also, **please don't** use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack our member-exclusive content. That's just not cool.
*   **The Site** totally reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban users** who break these rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Heads up! **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you prior notice.
*   If, for some reason, content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site** won't be held liable for any damages. Sorry about that!

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Just so we're clear: The information **the Site** provides is purely for reference. It **does NOT constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
*   And a big one: **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
*   So, what's the law of the land for these terms? **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to try and resolve things amicably through friendly negotiation first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll refer to as "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By hitting up our site or using anything we offer, you're totally agreeing to everything here!

## 1. Quick Intro to Our Services
**Our services** offer users premium, paid subscription content and exclusive member perks. This includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, special resources, ebooks, and community interaction. Just a heads-up: some of our top-tier content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Your Account
- To register for an account, **users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are fully responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **do not** transfer or share your account with anyone.
- If **users** break any of these terms, **the Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** their account. Play by the rules, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with all fees clearly shown on the checkout page. No surprises here!
- **All payments** are handled via third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **the Site** never stores your payment information.
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't want it to renew? Just cancel it in time!
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If **first-time subscribers** aren't happy with our service, they can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads up: Each user gets only one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless legally required.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use.
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, for learning!
- For **commercial use or extensive citation**, please reach out to **the Site** for authorization. We're happy to chat!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users are strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it clean!
- **It's a big no-no** to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content using technical means. Seriously, don't try it.
- **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. We're watching! ðŸ‘€

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Things change, you know?
- If **content** becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site** will **not be held liable for any compensation**. Stuff happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). Always consult an expert, okay?
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. That's where we hang!
- For **any disputes** arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try to resolve them amicably through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, folks!

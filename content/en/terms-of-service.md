# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, make sure you've given these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using the Site, you're basically saying, "Yep, I agree to all this stuff!"

## 1. About Our Services
Our Services are all about hooking you up with paid subscription content and exclusive membership perks ✨. Think blog posts, unique resources, e-books, and even community vibes! Just a heads-up: some of these goodies are only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get started, **users** need to register an account with a valid email and a secure password.
*   **Your account** security and all activities under it are totally on you. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account** – that's a big no-no! 🚫
*   **We** reserve the right to **suspend or terminate your account** if you breach these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact cost crystal clear on the checkout page.
*   **Payments** are handled securely via third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Don't sweat it, we never store your payment info ourselves.
*   **Your subscription** will **automatically renew**, so make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: If you're a first-timer and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. 💸 Just hit us up at the contact email below and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads-up: this is a one-time deal per user. Once those 14 days are up, or if it's not your first rodeo, all payments are final and **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** here is **copyrighted by hubtoday**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our express permission – seriously, don't do it!
*   **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for mass distribution!
*   If you're thinking about commercial use or citing us extensively, just **contact us** first to get that authorization sorted.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or stomps on anyone else's rights. Just don't! 🙅‍♀️
*   **Bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack** our member-exclusive content using technical tricks? That's a definite **no-go!** 🛑
*   **We** won't hesitate to remove any dodgy content and **ban users** who don't play by the rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even yank parts or all of our services whenever we need to, and we might not give you a heads-up. That's just how it rolls sometimes!
*   **The Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if our content is temporarily unreachable because of stuff like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Life happens! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The info we dish out** here is strictly for reference only and should **never be taken as professional advice** – seriously, that includes financial, legal, medical, or any other kind of pro guidance. Always check with a real expert! 💡
*   **We** are absolutely **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service**? They're governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, no matter what conflicting legal principles might pop up.
*   **Any beef** stemming from or related to these terms? We'll try to sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, folks!

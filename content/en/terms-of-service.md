# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're giving a thumbs-up 👍 to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
What are our services all about? 🤔 Well, **we hook users up** with paid subscription content and awesome member-exclusive services! This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, special resources, e-books, and even community interaction. Just a heads-up: some of our juiciest content is only for subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
Let's talk about **your account and registration**. 🔒 To get started, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Remember, you're the captain of your account's security and all the action happening on it – so keep it safe! Absolutely **no transferring or sharing** your account, please. If you ever break these terms, just know that **we have the right to suspend or terminate** your account. Bummer, we know.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
Alright, let's dive into our **paid subscription services**. 💰 Your subscription will be billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the juicy details about the fees right on the checkout page. Good news: all payments go through trusted third-party platforms (like Stripe and PayPal), so **we don't store your payment info** – secure and sound! Your subscription is set to **auto-renew**, so if you decide to jump off the wagon, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Now, for the sweet spot: our **14-day refund policy**! 🎉 If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Heads-up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
Regarding **content usage and intellectual property**: 🧠 Just so we're crystal clear, all our original content is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means you can't just copy, repost, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so. When you subscribe, you're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** – strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure. If you're thinking big-time commercial use or heavy quoting, please hit us up for authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Rules
Let's talk about **user conduct – the do's and don'ts**. 🚫 Here's the deal: it's absolutely **forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Also, please don't try to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content using any tech tricks – that's a big no-no. If we spot any naughty content, **we've got the right to remove it and even ban users** who don't play by the rules. Keep it clean, folks!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
Now, about **service changes and interruptions**. ⚠️ Just a heads-up: we reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services anytime, without needing to give you a heads-up. Life happens, right? If something unexpected like force majeure, a server hiccup, or a third-party service outage means you can't access content temporarily, **we won't be on the hook for any compensation**. We appreciate your understanding!

## 7. Disclaimer
Time for a **quick disclaimer**! 📢 The info we dish out on the site is purely for your reference – it's absolutely **not professional advice** (think financial, legal, medical, etc.). Also, if you happen to experience any direct or indirect losses from using our content or services, **we're generally not responsible** for that. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
When it comes to **governing law**, ⚖️ these Terms of Service are all about the laws of the State of California, USA, and they'll be interpreted accordingly, no matter any conflict of law principles. Should any little squabble pop up related to these terms, let's try to hash it out friendly-style first, okay? If we can't sort it out that way, then you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Fingers crossed we won't need to!

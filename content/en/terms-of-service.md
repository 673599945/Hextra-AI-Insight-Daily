# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*
---
Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive in, please take a moment to read our Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're giving us the thumbs up that you agree to these terms.

## 1. Services Overview
**Our Services** offer you paid subscription content and member perks like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community fun. Just a heads-up, some content is exclusively for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **To get started**, you'll need to register an account with a valid email address and set a password.
*   **Your account's security** and all its activities are totally on you. Seriously, don't even think about transferring or sharing it â€“ that's a big no-no.
*   **If you break these terms**, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with all fees clearly laid out for you on the checkout page.
*   **All your payments** go through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We never, ever store your payment info ourselves.
*   **Your subscription** will auto-renew like magic âœ¨ unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: if you're a first-timer and not totally thrilled with your subscription within 14 days of purchase, hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms for a full refund. Just tell us why! Heads up, though: each user gets only one refund shot. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, all payments are generally non-refundable, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All our original content** is copyrighted by us (hubtoday), so please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so.
*   **As a user**, you get non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights â€“ strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
*   **If you're eyeing commercial use** or want to quote a lot, hit us up for authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **You absolutely cannot** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Period.
*   **Don't even think about** mass downloading, scraping, or cracking our member content using any technical trickery. Seriously, no.
*   **We reserve the right** to remove any inappropriate content and give violating users the boot ðŸ‘¢. Fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We reserve the right** to change, pause, or totally stop any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up beforehand. Just so you know!
*   **If content goes temporarily poof** due to stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service outages, we can't be held responsible for any compensation. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The info we dish out** on this site is purely for reference. It's definitely *not* professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so don't take it as such!
*   **We're totally not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of California, USA, and we'll interpret them that way, ignoring any tricky conflict of law stuff.
*   **Got a dispute** related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first! If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal?

# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to really read through these Terms of Service. By just visiting or using our Site, you're essentially saying "Yep, I agree!" to all these terms. Cool?

## 1. About Our Services
So, what's the deal here? Well, **we** provide users with super cool paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, secret resources, e-books, community vibes, and more! 🤩 Just a heads-up, some of our best stuff is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   First off, **users** gotta register for an account. It's super easy: just drop a valid email address and set up a password.
*   **You**, the user, are fully in charge of your account's security and everything that happens on it. And listen up: passing your account around or sharing it is a big NO-NO. 🙅‍♀️
*   **We** also reserve the right to hit the 'pause' button (or even 'stop' altogether!) on any account if a user goes against these terms. Fair warning!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services**? They're billed either monthly or annually, and don't worry, all the fees are super clear on the checkout page. No surprises!
*   **All payments** go through awesome third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal – you know the drill 😉). Rest assured, we don't store your payment info ourselves.
*   Heads up: **subscriptions** will automatically renew! ✨ Unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends, of course.
*   **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet! 💸 If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of buying. Just hit us up at the email at the bottom of these terms and tell us what's up. Keep in mind, it's a one-time thing per user. After 14 days or if it's not your first rodeo, payments are generally non-refundable, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content**? That's our baby! 👶 It's copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday), and please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so.
*   **Users** only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass – purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure, nothing more. 😉
*   **For any commercial use or if you're planning a massive quote spree**, hit us up! We're happy to chat about authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Okay, let's talk vibes. **It's a definite NO** to upload, post, or spread anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringing on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it chill and respectful! 🙏
*   **Also, hands off!** 🚫 Bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack our member content using any tech trickery is strictly forbidden.
*   **We** reserve the right to zap any inappropriate content and give violating users the boot! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** totally reserve the right to change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without a heads-up. That's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
*   **We** can't take responsibility if content temporarily goes offline due to stuff beyond our control – think acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service snafus. No compensation liability there, sorry! 😔

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The info we dish out** here is purely for reference. Seriously, it's not professional advice of any kind – definitely not financial, legal, or medical. So, don't sue us for that! 😉
*   **We** are absolutely NOT responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service**? They're totally governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of sunny California, USA. We're keeping it simple and not messing with any conflict of law principles.
*   **Any disputes** that pop up because of or related to these terms? Let's try to chat it out nicely first, okay? If friendly talks don't work, then you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Game on! 🧑‍⚖️

# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll refer to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into all the cool stuff we offer, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By cruising around or using our services, you're basically saying, "Yep, I'm in!" to these terms.

## 1. What We Offer
The Site hooks you up with paid subscription content and exclusive member services. We're talking blog posts, special resources, eBooks, community vibes, and a whole lot more. Just a heads-up: some of these goodies are only for our subscribed members! ðŸš€

## 2. Your Account & Signing Up
- To create an account, you'll need to give us a valid email address and set up a password.
- You're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for anything that happens under your login. So, **no transferring or sharing your account**, got it?
- If you happen to break any of these terms, the Site has the right to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Deets
- Our subscription services are billed either monthly or yearly, and you'll see the exact cost spelled out crystal clear on the checkout page.
- All payments go through awesome third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Just to be clear: we never store your payment info on our end. Your financial deets are safe with them! ðŸ”’
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** â€“ heads up! â€“ unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- Here's the **14-day refund policy** scoop: If it's your very first time subscribing and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. This is a one-time deal per user! If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, re-post, or use it for commercial stuff without getting our permission first.
- As a user, you get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** for your personal learning and reading only.
- Need it for commercial use or quoting a bunch of it? Then you gotta contact the Site to snag some authorization.

## 5. User Conduct & Keeping Things Cool
- You are **strictly forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on someone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it.
- It's also **forbidden** to use any tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-only content. Play fair!
- The Site has the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban users who don't play by the rules**. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, pause, or totally ditch any part or all of our services whenever we want, without even giving you a heads-up.
- If you can't access content temporarily due to things like acts of nature, server glitches, or third-party service hiccups, the Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it's out of our hands.

## 7. Disclaimer (Read This!)
- The info we share on the Site is just for kicks and reference; it **doesn't count as** any kind of professional advice (think financial, legal, medical â€“ you get the drift).
- The Site **is absolutely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. The Legal Stuff
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, without fussing over conflict of law principles.
- For any beefs or disputes popping up from or related to these terms, we both agree to first try to work it out nicely through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.

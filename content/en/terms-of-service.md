*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. When you access or use the Site, it means you're totally on board with these terms.

## 1. Our Services
Our services? Well, the Site offers users paid subscription content and membership perks. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interactions, but isn't limited to just that. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed users!

## 2. User Registration & Account
- To register an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- If a user breaks these terms, we (the Site) reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** their account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, and you'll see the exact fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments go through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we absolutely do not store your payment info.
- Heads up: your subscription will **auto-renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- Alright, let's talk about our **14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're requesting a refund. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. Beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- Just so you know, all original content is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading.
- If you're eyeing our content for commercial use or extensive quoting, please shoot us a message to get authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Alright, here's the deal on user conduct: You are **strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
- And seriously, **don't** try to mass download, scrape, or crack our member content using technical tricks.
- If we spot any inappropriate content, we reserve the right to remove it and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you prior notice. Just a heads up!
- Look, stuff happens. If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things like force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, we (the Site) are **not liable for any compensation**.

## 7. Disclaimer
- Quick Disclaimer: The info we provide on this Site is just for reference. It's definitely **not** professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
- And hey, for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services, we (the Site) are **absolutely not responsible**.

## 8. Governing Law
- Regarding legal stuff, these Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

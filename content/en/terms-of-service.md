# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying 'I agree!' to these terms. ðŸ˜Ž

## 1. Service Overview
**The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and member services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interaction. Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   **Users** need a valid email address and a password to set up an account.
*   **Users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **no** transferring or sharing your account â€“ that's a big no-no!
*   **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're found breaking these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go through awesome third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, **the Site** doesn't store your payment info. Phew!
*   **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. So, keep an eye on that!
*   **14-Day Refund Policy**: If **first-time subscribers** aren't thrilled with our service, they can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for any non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless the law absolutely demands it. Tough love, but fair!

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, no unauthorized copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes. That's just not cool.
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal VIP pass!
*   If **you** need content for commercial use or extensive citations, hit up **the Site** to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **It's a big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things friendly!
*   **Also strictly forbidden** is using technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content. Seriously, don't even try.
*   **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned! ðŸš«

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** (that's **the Site**) totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just so you know!
*   If **content temporarily becomes unavailable** due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions, **the Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference. It's **not** professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always consult a pro for that stuff!
*   **The Site** will **not be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might face from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   **For any disputes** arising out of or related to these terms, both parties agree to try and sort things out amicably first. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let the legal eagles fly!

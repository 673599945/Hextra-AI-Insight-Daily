# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "the Site" or "we" from here on out). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By visiting or using the Site, you're agreeing to them ‚Äì plain and simple! üòâ

## 1. Services Overview
So, what's the deal here? **The Site** offers awesome paid subscription content and membership services to users. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of these goodies are only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To get started, **you'll need to create an account**. Just provide a valid email address and set a password.
*   Once you have an account, **you're totally responsible** for its security and all the activity happening on it. Seriously, **no** transferring or sharing your account ‚Äì it's just for you!
*   If you ever go against these terms, **we have the right to hit pause or even end** your account. Let's keep things smooth, okay?

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets on the checkout page.
*   When it comes to payments, **all transactions are handled** via awesome third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. FYI, we don't store any of your payment info ourselves.
*   Heads up: **your subscription will automatically renew**. So if you want to bail, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy is pretty cool**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. This is a one-time deal per user, by the way. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, all payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   Listen up: **all the original content here is copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission. Capiche?
*   As a user, **you're getting a non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** ‚Äì strictly for your personal learning and reading enjoyment.
*   If you're thinking big and want to use our stuff for commercial reasons or quote a bunch, **you'll need to reach out to us** for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Let's keep things chill. **You absolutely cannot upload, post, or spread** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or violates anyone else's rights. No funny business, alright?
*   Also, **don't even think about** using tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's a big no-no.
*   If things get out of line, **we've got the power to remove** inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Play nice! üö®

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Just so you know, **we reserve the right to change, pause, or even yank** any part or all of our services whenever we want, without telling you beforehand. It's just how the tech world rolls sometimes.
*   And hey, if something totally beyond our control happens ‚Äì like an act of God, server crashes, or a third-party service outage ‚Äì and you can't access content temporarily, **the Site won't be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but that's the deal.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   Quick heads-up: **the info you find on this Site is purely for reference**. It's **not** meant to be any kind of professional advice (think financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always check with a pro!
*   Also, **the Site is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just sayin'.

## 8. Governing Law
*   So, about the nitty-gritty: **these Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA**. We're not getting into those messy conflict-of-law principles here.
*   If any beef arises from or relates to these terms, **we both agree to try and sort it out amicably first**. But if we can't hug it out, you're cool with submitting the dispute to the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California. Fair game! ‚öñÔ∏è

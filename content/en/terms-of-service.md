# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereafter referred to as "the Site" or "we")! Before diving into our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By simply visiting or using our Site, you're essentially giving a big thumbs-up to these terms. 👍

## 1. What We Offer
The Site provides users with a whole bunch of paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions – and that's just scratching the surface! Heads up: some goodies are only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Accounts & Registration
- Getting started: Users just need to whip up an account with a valid email and a strong password. 💪
- Your account, your responsibility! Users are totally responsible for keeping their account safe and sound, and for all the fun stuff that happens on it. Sharing or transferring accounts? That's a big no-no. 🙅‍♀️
- Site's rights: The Site can totally hit the pause button or even kick out (terminate) an account if a user breaks these terms. Just sayin'! 🛑

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- How billing works: Subscription services are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs super clearly on the checkout page. No surprises! ✨
- Payments made easy: All your payments go through awesome third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal. Don't worry, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info. Your deets are safe. 🔐
- Auto-renewal magic: Subscriptions will **automatically renew** – poof! – unless you decide to cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Easy peasy. 🔄
- Our cool 14-day Refund Policy: If you're a first-timer signing up for our services and you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the bottom) and tell us why you're bouncing. One refund per user, though! After 14 days or if you're not a first-time subscriber, no refunds, sorry, unless the law steps in. Fair's fair! 💸

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- Who owns what: All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. We worked hard on it! 🧑‍💻
- Your access: Users get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass** just for personal learning and reading. It's like your personal library card. 📚
- Want to use it commercially? If you're looking to use our content for commercial purposes or want to quote a lot, just hit us up for authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- What's off-limits: Users are **strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it friendly! 🚫
- No sneaky stuff: Trying to bulk download, scrape, or crack our membership content with tech tricks? That's a definite **no-go**. 🚨
- Our right to act: The Site can totally yank out any inappropriate content and even **ban users who don't play by the rules**. Consider yourself warned! 👮‍♀️

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Our flexibility: We totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's how we roll! 🎢
- No liability for hiccups: If something totally out of our control happens – like a server crash or a third-party service going down – making our content temporarily unavailable, the Site **isn't on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know! 😔

## 7. Disclaimer
- Just for info: The info we share on the Site is purely for your reference. It's **not meant to be** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Always consult the pros! 👩‍⚖️👨‍⚕️
- Not our fault: The Site **won't be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just a heads-up! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
- The legal lowdown: These Terms of Service are all cozy with the laws of California, USA, and we'll interpret them that way, no funny business with conflicting laws. ⚖️
- Sorting out disputes: If we ever have a little spat or disagreement about these terms, we promise to try and chat it out friendly-like first. If that doesn't work, you're cool with taking it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🤞

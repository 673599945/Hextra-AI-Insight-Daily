# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to herein as "the **Site**" or "we")! Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to these terms.

## 1. Our Services
The Site provides users with paid subscription content and member services. These services include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up, some content is only for our subscribed users!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To register, users need to provide a valid email address and set a password for their account.
- Users, you're fully responsible for your account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account! 🚨
- The Site can, and will, **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms. 🛑

## 3. Paid Subscription Service
- Our subscription service operates on a monthly/annual billing cycle, with all fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
- All payments go through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, the Site never stores your payment info.
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** 🔄 unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms, explaining why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund, so use it wisely! After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are **non-refundable** 💸 unless legally mandated.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content, folks, is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without authorization? That's a big no-no! 🚫
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to the content, purely for personal learning and reading.
- For any commercial use or extensive quoting, please hit up the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Rules
- Users, it's a strict **no-go** 🙅‍♀️ for uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
- Also, **don't** try to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content using technical means. 🤖
- The Site has every right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions 🚧
- We, the Site, reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up.
- And hey, if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions, the Site is **not responsible for any compensation**.

## 7. Disclaimer 🛑
- The information provided by the Site is purely for reference. It **doesn't constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, medical, you name it!).
- For any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using the Site's content or services, the Site is **absolutely not responsible**.

## 8. Governing Law ⚖️
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should first try to resolve things amicably. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're essentially saying "I agree!" and accepting these terms. üòâ

## 1. Service Introduction
Our services at the Site offer users a treasure trove of paid subscription content and membership perks! This includes (but isn't limited to) awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, handy e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this premium content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration and Accounts
- Users, to get started, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register your account.
- Your account, dear user, is your responsibility! You're accountable for its security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account allowed.**
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if you ever decide to break these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact fees clearly stated on the checkout page. No surprises!
- All payments are handled securely through trusted third-party payment platforms (like Stripe and PayPal). Rest assured, the Site itself never stores your payment info.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! Make sure to cancel before the current billing cycle ends if you don't want to continue.
- Now, about our **14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and our service isn't quite hitting the mark within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund! Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) and tell us why. Heads up: this awesome refund offer is a one-time deal per user. If it's past 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Usage and Intellectual Property
- All original content on the Site is **copyrighted by hubtoday**, plain and simple! So, please don't copy, repost, or use it for commercial purposes without our express permission.
- Users, you're granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, purely for your personal learning and reading enjoyment.
- Commercial use or extensive citation of our content? You'll need to reach out to the Site first to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It is **strictly prohibited** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Play nice! üôè
- Also, it's **absolutely forbidden** to mass download, scrape, or try to crack our member-exclusive content using any technical trickery.
- The Site reserves the right to remove any naughty content and **ban users who break the rules**. Consider this your fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- We, meaning the Site, hold the right to tweak, pause, or even completely stop any part or all of our services at any moment, without giving you a heads-up. Just keeping it real!
- The Site wants you to know that if our content temporarily becomes unavailable because of things like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service interruptions, we **cannot be held liable for any compensation**. Life happens, right?

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information we dish out on the Site is purely for your reference. It absolutely **does not count** as any kind of professional advice (think financial, legal, medical ‚Äî you get the drift!).
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just so we're clear!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are super official, so they're governed by and will be interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA ‚Äì no drama with conflict of law principles here!
- Any disputes popping up from or related to these terms? We'd love for both parties to try and work things out amicably first. But if friendly chats don't cut it, then you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.

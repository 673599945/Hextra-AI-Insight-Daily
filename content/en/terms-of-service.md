# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

**ai.hubtoday** welcomes you! (We'll call it "this site" or "we" from now on ðŸ˜‰). Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By hitting up our site, you're basically saying, "Yep, I agree to all this!"

## 1. Service Introduction
**This site** offers users a treasure trove of paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interactions â€“ and that's just for starters! Psst, some content is just for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration and Account
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- **You** are totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for everything that happens under your login. Seriously, no transferring or sharing your account â€“ it's a big no-no!
- **This site** has the right to hit the pause button or even terminate your account if you ever break these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the juicy details about the fees right there on the checkout page. No surprises!
- **All payments** zip through secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, we don't stash any of your payment info on our end.
- **Subscriptions** will automatically renew, so you stay in the loop! Unless, of course, you decide to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our cool 14-day refund policy** is just for first-time subscribers! If you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (find it at the very bottom of these terms) and tell us why you're not vibing with it. Each user gets this golden ticket just once. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are non-refundable, unless the law steps in and says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
- **All original content** here is copyrighted by this site (hubtoday). So, no unauthorized copying, reposting, or using it for commercial stuff, okay? ðŸ˜‰
- **Users** get a non-exclusive, non-transferable pass to access our content, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- **For commercial use or if you want to quote a lot** of our stuff, please hit us up to get authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Seriously, it's a big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Keep it cool!
- **And definitely don't try** to bulk download, scrape, or hack our member content using technical wizardry. That's a definite red flag!
- **This site** has the power to yank inappropriate content and even ban users who aren't playing by the rules. You've been warned! ðŸš«

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or totally stop any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes.
- **This site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if our content is temporarily unreachable due to stuff like acts of nature, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Life happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- **Heads up! The information we dish out on this site** is purely for reference. It's not, like, official professional advice (so don't treat it as financial, legal, or medical guidance, okay?).
- **This site** isn't responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of California, USA, and that's how we'll interpret them, without getting tangled up in conflict of law stuff.
- **Any squabbles or disagreements** popping up from or related to these terms? Let's try to hash it out nicely first! If we can't sort it out, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it.

## 9. Contact Us
- **Got questions** about these terms? Don't be shy! Hit us up via the following:

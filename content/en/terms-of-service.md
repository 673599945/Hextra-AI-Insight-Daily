# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it 'the Site' or 'us' from now on). Before you dive in and start using our services, give these Terms of Service a good read. By clicking around or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. Got it?

## 1. What We're All About (Service Intro)
So, what's the deal here? Well, the Site hooks you up with paid subscription content and member services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and awesome community vibes â€“ just to name a few. Heads up: some of this good stuff is only for our subscribed users!

## 2. Your Account & Registration
*   To register for an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
*   Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all the activity happening on it. Oh, and by the way, **no transferring or sharing your account**. That's a big nope!
*   The Site has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they decide to break these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis. You'll see the exact fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
*   All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). FYI, we don't store any of your payment info ourselves. Your deets are safe!
*   Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. Don't forget if you want to stop!
*   **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. Fair's fair!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content **is copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission. That's a big no-no!
*   Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to the content, purely for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, pal!
*   Need it for commercial use or want to quote a lot? Just reach out to the Site to get proper authorization. We're usually pretty cool!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't.
*   **Absolutely no bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking** member content using any technical trickery. We see you!
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any users who break the rules**. Play nice, or get the boot!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how it is sometimes.
*   If something wild happens â€“ like an act of God, server meltdown, or a third-party service just flakes out, making content temporarily unavailable â€“ the Site **isn't on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it's out of our hands.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The info we dish out on the Site is purely for reference. It **doesn't count as** any kind of professional advice (think financial, legal, medical, etc.). So, don't take it as gospel!
*   For any direct or indirect losses users might get from using our content or services, the Site **is absolutely not responsible**. Just so we're clear!

## 8. Governing Law
These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, without messing with its conflict of law principles. If any beef arises from or relates to these terms, we both agree to try and sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to take the dispute to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Let's keep it civil, folks!

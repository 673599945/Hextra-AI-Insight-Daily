# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter referred to as "the Site" or "we")! ✨ Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. What We Offer
Our services at the Site are all about hooking you up with paid subscription content and exclusive member perks! Think blog posts, unique resources, e-books, community vibes, and more. Heads up: some content is just for our awesome subscribers. 😉

## 2. Your Account
- To get your account set up, **users** will need to provide a valid email address and pick a password. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally on the hook for their account's security and all the action that happens on it. And listen up: transferring or sharing your account is a big no-no – **strictly forbidden**!
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a **user's** account if they ever break these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscriptions
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises there!
- **All payments** are processed through trusted third-party payment platforms (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), so don't sweat it – we never store your payment info. Your deets are safe. 🔒
- Your **subscription** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up. Easy to manage! 💪
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: For first-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for any subsequent subscriptions, payments are **non-refundable** unless the law explicitly says otherwise. Fair's fair! 💰

## 4. Using Our Content & IP Rights
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our express permission. Capisce?
- **Users** are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal! 🤓
- For commercial use or if you're looking to quote us heavily, please hit up the Site to get proper authorization. We're usually pretty chill!

## 5. Playing Nice: Your Conduct
- **Uploading, posting, or distributing** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights is **strictly prohibited**. Let's keep it clean, folks! 🚫
- **Using technical means** to bulk download, crawl, or crack member content is also a big fat **NO**. Seriously, don't even try it.
- The Site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users who violate these rules**. Consider this your friendly warning! 🚨

## 6. Heads Up: Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just so you know!
- The Site will **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like force majeure, server malfunctions, or third-party service outages. Tech happens! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The **information provided by the Site** is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Don't take it as gospel!
- The Site will **not be held responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. The Legal Stuff: Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted according to the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, West Coast rules apply! 🌴
- For **any disputes** arising from or related to these terms, both parties agree to first try and resolve them amicably through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first, though! 🙏

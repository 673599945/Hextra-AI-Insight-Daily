# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as “**the Site**” or “**we**”). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you’re agreeing to and accepting these terms. So, let’s get started! 👋

## 1. About Our Services
Here at the Site, we offer users a range of paid subscription content and membership services. These cool offerings include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribed members. 🌟

## 2. User Registration & Your Account
*   To register an account, users simply need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
*   Users are fully responsible for the security of their account and all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account with anyone else. Keep it safe! 🔒
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these Terms. We gotta keep things fair!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis. You'll see all the costs clearly displayed on the checkout page, no hidden surprises! 💰
*   All payments are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). The Site doesn't store any of your payment info, so you're in good hands.
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so keep that in mind! You'll need to cancel before the end of your current billing cycle if you don't want to keep it going. 🔄
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy** allows first-time subscribers to request a full refund if they're not happy with the service within 14 days from the purchase date. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these Terms and let us know why you're looking for a refund. Each user gets one refund shot, so use it wisely! After 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless legally required. Fair enough? 😉

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission – that's a big no-no! 🚫
*   You, as a user, only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for resale!
*   For commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site to get authorization first. We're usually pretty cool about it, just ask! 👍

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are strictly prohibited from uploading, publishing, or spreading any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it clean and respectful, folks! 😇
*   It's also a big no-no to mass download, scrape, or crack member content using technical means. Seriously, play fair! 🙅‍♀️
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any violating users**. Consider this your heads-up! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just letting you know that things can evolve! 💨
*   The Site **won't be held liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands! 🤷‍♂️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only. It **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical advice). So, don't take it as gospel for your big life decisions! 😉
*   The Site **will not be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Use your best judgment, okay?

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. That's where we play by the rules! ⚖️
*   For any disputes arising from or related to these Terms, both parties should first try to resolve them through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🤞

# Service Terms

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll be calling ourselves "**this site**" or "**us**" from now on)! 🎉 Before you jump in and use our services, please take a good, hard look at these Service Terms. By hitting up our site, you're basically saying, "Yep, I'm in!" and agreeing to everything here. So, read up! 👇

## 1. Our Services Unpacked
So, what's the deal here? This site hooks you up with a fantastic array of paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think beyond just blog posts – we're talking exclusive resources, e-books, and even cool community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of our juiciest content is strictly for our awesome subscribers! ✨

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- To get started, you'll need to register an account by giving us a valid email address and picking a secure password. Simple!
- Your account is *your* responsibility! You're totally on the hook for its security and everything that happens with it. And seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no!** 🙅‍♀️
- Heads up: if you ever break these rules, this site has the right to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. The Lowdown on Paid Subscriptions
- Our subscriptions are super flexible, billed either monthly or annually. You'll always see the exact fees crystal clear on the checkout page. No surprises!
- Don't sweat your payment info! All transactions are securely handled by awesome third-party payment platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We don't touch or store your payment details, promise. 🔒
- Your subscription is set to **auto-renew** – pretty handy, right? Just remember to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want the next one.
- **Our Sweet 14-Day Refund Policy!** 🎉 First-timer? If you're not absolutely thrilled with our service within 14 days of buying, no worries! You can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the bottom of these terms) and tell us why you're bouncing. Oh, and this generous offer is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're a returning subscriber, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law *really* says otherwise. Bummer, we know! 🤷‍♀️

## 4. Content & Who Owns What (aka IP)
- Listen up: all the awesome original content here is **copyrighted by this site (hubtoday)**. That means no unauthorized copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. Seriously, don't do it! 🚫
- You get a cool, **non-exclusive, non-transferable pass to access** our content. But it's just for your personal learning and reading, okay?
- Wanna use our stuff for commercial gigs or quote us extensively? Awesome! Just hit us up and get our authorization first. Easy peasy. 😉

## 5. Playing Nice: User Conduct Rules
- Alright, let's keep things respectful and legal! You're **forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading anything illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or anything that steps on other people's rights. Be cool, folks! ✌️
- Also, **don't even think about** using tech tricks to bulk download, crawl, or crack into our member-only content. That's a definite red flag! 🚩
- If we spot any funky business, this site has the power to yank inappropriate content and **permanently ban users who break the rules**. No kidding.

## 6. Service Shakes & Stops
- Heads up! We might tweak, pause, or even stop some or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls! 🚀
- Bummer alert: if our content goes dark temporarily because of things totally out of our control – like acts of nature, server meltdowns, or third-party service hiccups – this site is **not on the hook for any compensation**. We're just being real here.

## 7. Our No-Guarantees Disclaimer
- Just so we're clear: the info we share on this site is purely for your reference. It's **not professional advice** – so don't take it as financial, legal, medical, or any other kind of expert guidance. Got it? 👍
- And hey, this site is **not responsible** for any losses, big or small, that you might suffer from using our content or services. Use your best judgment, always!

## 8. The Legal Stuff: Governing Law
- Alright, for all the legal eagle stuff, these Service Terms are rockin' under the laws of the State of California, USA. We're keeping it simple and sticking to their rules, ignoring any pesky conflict of law principles.
- Got a beef or a dispute about these terms? Let's try to chat it out peacefully first, okay? If we can't hug it out and settle things amicably, then you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. They'll be the ultimate deciders! 🧑‍⚖️

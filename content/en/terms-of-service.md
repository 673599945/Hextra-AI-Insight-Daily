# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

üëã Welcome to **ai.hubtoday**! Before you jump into using our awesome services, please do us a solid and read these Terms of Service carefully. Seriously, by just visiting or using this site, you're pretty much saying 'Yep, I agree!' to everything here.

## 1. Our Services ‚ú®
Our services are all about giving you awesome paid subscription content and member benefits! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and even community vibes. Just a heads-up: some of the extra good stuff is only for our subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts üîí
To register an account, you'll need to hook us up with a valid email address and set up a password.
- When it comes to your account, you're fully responsible for keeping it safe and for everything that happens under your login. Seriously, **do not** transfer or share your account with anyone else ‚Äì that's a big no-no!
- If you happen to break any of these terms, we've got the right to **pause or even close down** your account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services üí≥
Our subscription services are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All your payments go through secure third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.), so don't sweat it ‚Äì we never store your payment info ourselves.
- Your subscription will **automatically renew**, unless you decide to cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- Let's talk about our **14-Day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find the contact info at the end of these terms) and let us know why you're bouncing. Heads up: this awesome refund offer is a one-time deal per user. If it's been more than 14 days, or if this isn't your first rodeo with a subscription, then typically, we can't offer refunds, unless the law specifically says we have to.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property üìù
All the original content you find here is **copyrighted by hubtoday**, so please, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without getting our permission first.
- As a user, you get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** to our content, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- If you're looking to use our content for commercial stuff or want to cite a whole lot of it, just hit us up to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines üö´
Regarding user conduct, **do not** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights ‚Äì that's a hard pass!
- Also, it's a strict **no-go** to use any techy methods for bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member-exclusive content.
- We reserve the right to remove any content we deem inappropriate and will definitely **ban users** who don't play by the rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions ‚ö†Ô∏è
About service changes and interruptions, we totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up.
- If, for some reason (like an act of nature, server oopsies, or a third-party service taking a nap), our content becomes temporarily unavailable, **we won't be on the hook for any compensation**.

## 7. Disclaimer ‚õî
Our disclaimer is pretty straightforward: Any info we dish out on this site is purely for your reference and **should not be taken as** professional advice ‚Äì seriously, that includes financial, legal, medical, or any other kind of expert guidance.
- And when it comes to any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services, we're simply **not liable, period**.

## 8. Governing Law ‚öñÔ∏è
When it comes to the legal stuff, these Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA ‚Äì and we're totally skipping any conflict-of-law principles here.
- If any beef pops up because of or related to these terms, we both agree to try and sort it out amicably first. But hey, if we can't hug it out, you agree that any unresolved disputes will be handled by the courts with proper jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California.

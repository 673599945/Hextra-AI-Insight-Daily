# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "the Site" or "we" from here on out). Before you jump into using any of our services, you *really* need to give these Terms of Service a good read. Seriously, by just visiting or using the Site, you're signaling your agreement and acceptance of everything laid out here.

## 1. What Our Services Are All About

So, what do we offer? Well, **the Site** is here to hook you up with paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, super special resources, e-books, and even cool community interactions – just to name a few goodies. Oh, and fair warning: some of our juiciest content is just for our subscribed users! 😉

## 2. Getting Your Account Set Up (And Keeping It Safe!)

- To register an account with us, **users** just need a valid email address and to set up a password. Easy peasy!
- Listen up: **users** are totally responsible for keeping their account secure and for *everything* that happens under it. So, **sharing or transferring your account is a big NO-NO!**
- If **users** break these terms, **the Site** absolutely has the right to **pause or even shut down** their account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Let's Talk About Paid Subscriptions

- Our **subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually – you'll see the exact cost crystal clear on the checkout page. No surprises here!
- Good news: **all payments** go through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. This means **the Site** *never* stores your payment info. Phew!
- Heads up! Your **subscription** will **automatically renew** by default. If you don't want that to happen, just make sure you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: If you're a **first-time subscriber** and you're not absolutely thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) and tell us why you're not happy. Quick note: each user gets *one* refund chance. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, your payment is generally **non-refundable** unless the law *really* says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Who Owns What (Intellectual Property stuff)

- Just so we're clear: **all original content** you find here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you absolutely cannot copy, repost, or use it for commercial stuff without our express permission. Got it?
- What you *do* get is a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for your own personal learning and reading pleasure. Think of it as a library pass just for you! 📚
- If you're thinking about using our content for commercial purposes or quoting a bunch of it, please, please, please **contact the Site** first to get authorization. We're usually pretty friendly! 😉

## 5. Let's Be Good Users (Conduct Guidelines!)

- So, what's off-limits? You are absolutely **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading *any* content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things respectful, okay?
- Also, it's a big **NO-NO** to use technical wizardry to mass download, scrape, or "crack" our member-exclusive content. Seriously, don't even try.
- If you do any of the above, **the Site** has the full right to yank down that bad content and even **ban users who break the rules**. You've been warned! 🚫

## 6. Heads Up! About Service Changes & Interruptions

- Just so you know, **we** totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts (or all!) of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the digital world works sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
- If for some reason our content becomes temporarily unavailable – maybe due to things like acts of God (force majeure), server hiccups, or issues with our third-party services – then **the Site** is **not responsible for any compensation**. We'll do our best, but sometimes things are out of our hands.

## 7. Our Big Disclaimer (Read This!)

- The **information** **the Site** provides is purely for reference, folks. It absolutely **does NOT count** as any kind of professional advice – whether it's financial, legal, medical, or anything else you might need a pro for. Always consult an expert! 🧠
- And listen, **the Site** is **not responsible** for any losses, direct or indirect, that you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. The Nitty-Gritty on Governing Law

- So, **these Terms of Service**? They're gonna be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA 🇺🇸, without even thinking about those pesky conflict of law principles.
- If, by some chance, **any dispute** pops up related to these terms, both sides agree to try and sort it out amicably first. But if we can't hug it out, you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. They've got the jurisdiction for this kind of thing!

# Terms of Service

*Effective: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "the **Site**" or "us" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "Yep, I agree!" to all these terms. 😊

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers a bunch of awesome paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and cool community interactions! Just a heads-up, some goodies are exclusively for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration and Account
- **To get started**, you'll need to register an account with a valid email and set up a password.
- **Your account's security** and all activities under it are totally your responsibility. And just so we're clear: **no transferring or sharing** your account, okay? 🚫
- **If you ever breach these terms**, the Site reserves the right to **pause or even terminate** your account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, with all the costs laid out clearly on the checkout page. No hidden fees, promise!
- **All your payments** will go through awesome third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Just to put your mind at ease, we never store your payment info ourselves. 🔒
- **Your subscription** will **automatically renew** – super convenient! – unless you decide to cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Here's our cool 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund! Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, **we generally don't offer refunds** unless the law explicitly says we have to. Sorry! 🤷‍♀️

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
- **All the original content** here at hubtoday is **our copyrighted stuff**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial purposes without our say-so. Period.
- **As a user**, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it to yourself, alright? 😉
- **If you're thinking commercial use** or need to cite a lot, please get in touch with us first for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **You absolutely cannot** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it. 🙅‍♂️
- **Bulk downloading**, scraping, or cracking our member content using any technical trickery is also a big fat **NO**. Just enjoy it as intended!
- **The Site** reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- **We** can change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services anytime we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how things roll sometimes. 🤷
- **If content becomes temporarily unavailable** due to things like natural disasters (force majeure), server hiccups, or issues with third-party services, **we can't be held responsible for any compensation**. Bummer, we know.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info we provide** on the Site is strictly for your general reference. It's **not** professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so please don't treat it as such.
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might run into from using our content or services. Just a heads-up!

## 8. Applicable Law
- **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of the State of California, USA, and that's how we'll interpret them, no matter what other legal principles might pop up.
- **If any disputes** crop up because of or related to these terms, we both agree to try and sort it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the awesome courts in Santa Clara County, California.

# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it 'the Site' or 'us' from now on). Before you dive in, please give these Terms of Service a quick read. Seriously, by using or even just visiting our site, you're agreeing to them!

## 1. What We Offer
So, what's **ai.hubtoday** all about? Well, we hook you up with paid subscription content and awesome membership services! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and engaging community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of our juiciest content is exclusively for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. Your Account & Registration
*   **Users** gotta hook us up with a valid email address and pick a password to get their account registered. Pretty standard stuff.
*   **Users** are totally on the hook for their account's security and anything that happens under their login. And hey, absolutely **NO** transferring or sharing your account, got it? That's a big no-no.
*   **We** (that's **ai.hubtoday**) totally reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they go rogue and violate these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscriptions
*   **Subscription services**? They're billed either monthly or annually, and don't sweat it, all the fees are super clear on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💸
*   **All payments** go through awesome third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. This means **we** don't store any of your sensitive payment info, keeping things extra secure! 🔒
*   **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** – just a heads-up! So, if you don't want to keep the good times rolling, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   Okay, let's talk about our awesome **14-day refund policy**! 🥳 If you're a first-time subscriber and you're just not feeling it within 14 days of your purchase, no worries – you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email listed at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: each user only gets one shot at this refund. And sadly, if it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, we generally can't offer refunds, unless the law specifically says otherwise. So, make sure you love it! ❤️

## 4. Content Use & IP Rights
*   **All original content**? That's right, it's all **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**! So, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without getting our permission first. Play nice! 😉
*   **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright?
*   **For commercial use or if you want to quote a lot** from our stuff, please, please, please reach out to **us** first to get authorization. We're usually pretty cool, just ask! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   **It's strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep the vibe positive, folks! ✨
*   **It's also a big no-no** to try and bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content using any tech trickery. Seriously, don't do it. 🙅‍♀️
*   **We** (that's **ai.hubtoday**) absolutely have the right to zap any inappropriate content and even **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   **We** reserve the right to shake things up, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the tech world rolls sometimes! 🤷‍♂️
*   **We** here at **ai.hubtoday** won't be on the hook for any compensation if our content is temporarily chilling offline due to stuff like acts of nature, server hiccups, or if a third-party service flakes out. It happens! 🚧

## 7. Disclaimer
*   **The info we dish out** here at **ai.hubtoday** is purely for reference. Seriously, it **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice – like financial, legal, or medical. Always consult the pros for that! 🧑‍⚕️⚖️💰
*   **We** at **ai.hubtoday** are **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
*   **These Terms of Service**? They're totally governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, without even glancing at those tricky conflict of law principles. So, California rules!
*   **Any disputes popping up from or related to these terms**? We're all about friendly chats first to sort things out. But if we can't hug it out, you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Let the legal eagles fly! 🦅

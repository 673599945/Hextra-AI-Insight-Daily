# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "**This Site**" or "**We**"). Before you dive into using This Site's services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using This Site, you're essentially saying "Yep, I agree!" to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
**This Site** powers up users with paid subscription content and exclusive membership services. Think blog posts, unique resources, e-books, and lively community interactions – and that's just the start! Heads up: some premium content is only for our awesome subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To get started, **users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a secure password to register for an account.
- Once you're in, **users** are fully responsible for their account's security and all the action happening within it. Seriously, transferring or sharing accounts is a big **NO-NO**!
- Heads up: **This Site** has the right to **pause or pull the plug** on a user's account if they're not playing by these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually – your choice! The exact fees? They'll be crystal clear on the checkout page.
- Good news: **all payments** breeze through secure third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We don't store any of your payment info here, so your details are safe and sound!
- Just so you know, **subscriptions** will **automatically renew** – it's super convenient! But if you want to opt out, just cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- Alright, listen up for our **14-day refund policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) and let us know why you're not happy. Quick heads-up: each user gets just one shot at a refund. If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, then unless the law literally forces our hand, payments are a big **NO-REFUND** deal after purchase.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- Here's the deal with **all original content**: It's **copyrighted by This Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial gigs without our explicit say-so!
- What you get as a **user** is a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access pass** – purely for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. Think of it as your private library!
- Wanna use our stuff for **commercial purposes or quote us extensively**? Awesome! Just hit up This Site to snag that authorization first.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Seriously, **it's a strict no-go** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Let's keep things respectful!
- And absolutely, **it's prohibited** to pull off any techy stunts like bulk downloading, crawling, or cracking our member content. That's just not cool.
- Just to be clear: **This Site** has every right to yank down any inappropriate content and will totally **boot out users** who break the rules.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Quick heads-up: **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even completely shut down parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a prior nudge. That's just how the digital world rolls sometimes!
- Bummer, but if content becomes temporarily unreachable due to stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service glitches, **This Site** won't be on the hook for any **compensation**.

## 7. Disclaimer
- Just a friendly reminder: **The information This Site dishes out** is purely for reference. It definitely **does NOT count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Always get expert advice when you need it!
- So, if users happen to run into any direct or indirect losses because they used This Site's content or services, **This Site** pretty much says, "**Nope, not our fault!**"

## 8. Governing Law
- Alright, let's talk law: **These Terms of Service** are totally governed by and will be interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA – without getting bogged down in those tricky conflict of laws principles.
- Should any **disputes pop up** that are connected to or arise from these terms, both sides promise to try and hash things out friendly-style first. If that doesn't quite work, then you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California – they've got the jurisdiction, so they're the ones to handle it!

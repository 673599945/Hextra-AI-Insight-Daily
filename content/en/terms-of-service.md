# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (let's call it "the Site" or "we")! 👋 Before you jump in and use our awesome services, please take a sec to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. ✨

## 1. About Our Services
So, what's the deal? 🤔 The Site offers users paid subscription content and member services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interactions. Just a heads-up: some content is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- User Accounts & Registration: To get started, you'll need to provide a valid email and set up a password to register for an account.
- You, as a user, are super responsible for your account's security and *everything* that happens under it – so keep it safe! 🔒 And a big NO-NO: don't even think about transferring or sharing your account.
- The Site (yep, that's us!) can totally suspend or even terminate your account if you break these terms. 🙅‍♀️

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed monthly or annually. You'll see the exact fees crystal clear on the checkout page.
- All payments zoom through third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal) – don't sweat it, the Site never stores your payment info. 🛡️
- Subscriptions will auto-renew, so if you're planning to bounce, make sure you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up. 🗓️
- Now for the cool part – our 14-day refund policy! 💸 First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just ping us via the contact email at the end of these terms and spill the beans on why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at this refund, so use it wisely! After 14 days, or if you've subscribed before, payments are generally non-refundable, unless the law *really* says otherwise. (Bummer, we know!)

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- Alright, all original content here is copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday). So, big no-no again: no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our explicit permission! 🚫
- You, as a user, only get a non-exclusive, non-transferable access right, purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. 🤓
- For commercial use or if you want to quote extensively, please hit up the Site to get authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Let's keep things chill and respectful, okay? 🙏 Don't upload, post, or spread *any* content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it. 🚩
- Also, hands off: don't try to mass download, scrape, or crack member content using techy tricks.
- The Site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will totally ban users who violate these rules. Bye-bye! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruption
- Look, things change. 🤷‍♀️ We reserve the right to tweak, suspend, or even pull the plug on parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up.
- If content is temporarily unavailable due to stuff like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service outages, the Site won't be on the hook for compensation. We'll do our best, though! ✨

## 7. Disclaimer
- Disclaimer Time! 🚨 The info we provide on the Site is just for reference, not professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, or medical stuff – seriously, talk to an expert!).
- The Site is NOT responsible for any direct or indirect losses you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real! 👍

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are run by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA. No tricky conflict-of-law stuff here.
- If a dispute pops up related to these terms, let's try to hash it out nicely first. 🤝 If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. So there!

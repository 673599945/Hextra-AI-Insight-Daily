# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we")! Before you start using our services, please take a good look at these Terms of Service. By simply accessing or using our Site, you're agreeing to be bound by these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
**Our services** offer users a sweet deal of paid subscription content and membership perks, like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and cool community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is only for our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Account
- To get started, **users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password for their account.
- Heads up: **users** are fully responsible for keeping their account secure and for all activity under it. Absolutely **no transferring or sharing** your account—that's a big no-no.
- Fair warning: **we** can **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they don't play by these rules.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our **subscription services** are billed monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- Good news: **all payments** go through trusted third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal. This means **we** never store your payment info, keeping things super secure.
- Your **subscription** will **automatically renew**! If you don't want that to happen, just make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- Check out **our cool 14-day refund policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of buying, you can grab a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the bottom of these terms) and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: this is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, all sales are final—**no refunds** after payment, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- Just so we're clear: **all original content** here is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**. That means you can't go copying, re-posting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so.
- **Users** get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content—it's just for your personal learning and reading, no funny business!
- **Need it for commercial use or want to quote a bunch**? Just hit us up for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Seriously, **users are absolutely forbidden from** uploading, posting, or sharing anything that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on other people's rights.
- Also, **don't even think about** bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to hack into member content using tech tricks. That's a definite no-go.
- If you mess up, **we** get to remove inappropriate content and **kick out (ban) users** who break the rules. No second chances!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Heads up! **We** can totally change, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a prior heads-up.
- If things go sideways—like, due to acts of nature, server meltdowns, or third-party service hiccups that make content temporarily unreachable—**we're not on the hook for any compensation**. Just sayin'.

## 7. Disclaimer
- Quick note: **the info we dish out** on this site is purely for your reference. It's definitely **not** professional advice—so don't take it as financial, legal, or medical guidance, okay?
- And speaking of disclaimers: **we're not responsible** for any losses, big or small, that you might suffer from using our content or services. Use at your own risk!

## 8. Governing Law
- Just so you know, **these Terms of Service** follow the laws of California, USA, and will be interpreted based on those laws, without fussing over conflict-of-law principles.
- If **any disputes** pop up because of or related to these terms, let's try to chat it out nicely first. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California, handle it.

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the **Site**" or "we"). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're basically saying, "Yep, I agree to these terms!"

## 1. Services Overview
The Site offers users a sweet selection of paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only available to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To sign up for an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities that happen under it. **Absolutely no** transferring or sharing your account, got it?
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed monthly or annually, with all fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, the Site doesn't store any of your payment info. üòé
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just shoot us an email at the contact address provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're unhappy. Each user gets one refund shot. If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** the content, strictly for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your private library! ü§ì
- If you're looking for commercial use or want to quote us extensively, please get in touch with the Site to obtain authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a **big no-no** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
- Also, **don't even think about** using technical means to mass download, scrape, or crack our member content. That's just not cool. üö´
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- Heads up: We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Sorry, not sorry! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **won't be liable for compensation**. Just a heads up!

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info provided on the Site is purely for reference and **doesn't constitute** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). So don't go making big life decisions based just on us! üòâ
- For any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using the Site's content or services, the Site is **not responsible at all**. You're on your own there!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- For any disputes arising from or related to these terms, both parties should totally try to sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

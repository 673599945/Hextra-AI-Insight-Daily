*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka ‚Äú**the Site**‚Äù or ‚Äú**we**‚Äù). Before you dive in, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our services, you're totally agreeing to these terms.

## 1. What We Offer (Our Services)
Our Site offers paid subscription content and member services. These sweet perks include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for our awesome subscribers!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account. Easy peasy.
- Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no** transferring or sharing your account ‚Äì keep it to yourself!
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** any account if a user violates these terms. Play by the rules, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis. Don't worry, the fees will be clearly shown on the checkout page before you commit.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we **do not** store your payment information directly.
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before the end of your current billing cycle. Just a heads up!
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to the content, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal!
- For commercial use or extensive citation, please contact the Site to get proper authorization. Let's chat first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Users are strictly **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep things chill and respectful, okay?
- It's also strictly **prohibited** to mass download, crawl, or crack member content using technical means. No sneaky business!
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. Don't say we didn't warn ya!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just so you know, things can shift!
- The Site **will not be liable for compensation** if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only. It **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). So, don't take it as gospel for critical decisions, okay?
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users due to their use of our content or services. Just a heads up on that one.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a wall, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

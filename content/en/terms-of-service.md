# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll call it "**This Site**" or "**We**" from here on out). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using This Site, you're essentially saying, "Yep, I agree to these terms!"

## 1. What We Offer (Our Services in a Nutshell) ✨
**This Site** is all about hooking you up with premium, paid subscription content and snazzy membership services. Think blog posts, super exclusive resources, cool e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of our juiciest content is exclusively for our subscribed members!

## 2. Signing Up & Your Account 🔒
*   You'll need to give us a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   You're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for all the activity happening under it. **Absolutely NO transferring or sharing your account**, got it? 🛑
*   If you ever go rogue and break these terms, **This Site** has the right to **pause or even terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. All About Paid Subscriptions 💸
*   Our subscription service is billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   Just so you know, all payments go through super secure third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. **This Site** never actually stores your payment info – we wouldn't even know what to do with it! 😉
*   Heads-up: your subscription will **automatically renew**! If you don't want that to happen, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
*   Here's the cool part: our **14-Day Refund Policy**! 🤝 If you're a first-time subscriber and our service just isn't jiving with you, you can ask for a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets this one-time refund chance, so use it wisely! After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces us to.

## 4. Using Our Content & Intellectual Property ©
*   **All original content** on **This Site** is **copyrighted by hubtoday**. So, please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without getting our permission first.
*   You, as a user, get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access our content, purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
*   Thinking of using our stuff for commercial purposes or quoting a bunch of it? Awesome! Just **reach out to This Site** to get the necessary authorization.

## 5. User Conduct - Play Nice! 🚫
*   You are **strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Let's keep it clean, folks!
*   It's a big **NO-NO** to use any technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack open our member-exclusive content. That's just not cool.
*   **This Site** reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will **ban users** who don't play by the rules. Consider this your friendly warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions ⚠️
*   **We** reserve the right to change, pause, or even completely stop parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes.
*   If something totally out of our control happens – like an act of God, server meltdowns, or a third-party service outage – and you can't access content temporarily, **This Site will NOT be held liable for any damages**. Bummer, we know, but it's beyond our control.

## 7. Disclaimer - Read Carefully! 🚨
*   Heads up: The information **This Site** provides is strictly for reference purposes only. It's **NOT** meant to be professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Seriously, talk to a pro!
*   **This Site** is **NOT responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might suffer from using our content or services. Just keeping it real here.

## 8. Governing Law ⚖️
Alright, let's talk legal stuff. **These Terms of Service** are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, USA – no matter what those conflict-of-law principles say. Got a beef related to these terms? First off, let's try to resolve it amicably, together! If we can't sort it out with a friendly chat, then you agree to take any disputes to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 🤞

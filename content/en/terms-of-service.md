# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "this site" or "we" from here on out)! ðŸŽ‰ Before you dive into our awesome services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our site, you're totally on board and agreeing to these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
So, what's the deal here? ðŸ¤” This site hooks you up with paid subscription content and super cool membership services. We're talking blog posts, exclusive goodies, e-books, community vibes, and more! Just a heads-up: some of this awesome content is only for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
Alright, time to talk **User Accounts**. To snag an account, you'll need a valid email address and to set up a password. Remember, you're the boss of your account's security and everything that happens on it! ðŸš¨ **Seriously, don't even think about** transferring or sharing your account â€“ that's a big no-no. If you break these rules, this site has the right to **pause or totally shut down** your account. Ouch!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
Let's get into **Paid Subscription Services**. Your subscription will be billed monthly or annually â€“ don't worry, all the fees are super clear on the checkout page. ðŸ’³ All payments zip through secure third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal), so relax, this site **never** stores your payment deets. Your subscription will **auto-renew** like clockwork, unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up. Now, for the sweet part: our **14-day Refund Policy**! ðŸŽ‰ If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the very end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Heads up: this awesome refund is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
Okay, **Content Use and Intellectual Property** time! ðŸ’¡ Every single piece of original content here is **copyrighted by this site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial stuff without getting our green light first! As a user, you get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** it â€“ strictly for your personal learning and reading adventures. If you're dreaming of commercial use or quoting a ton, hit us up to get authorization!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
Let's talk **User Conduct** â€“ gotta keep things chill and respectful! ðŸš« **Seriously, don't** upload, post, or spread anything that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Also, absolutely **no bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack** our member content with any tech wizardry. If you do, this site has every right to yank down that funky content and **boot rule-breaking users** right off the platform. You've been warned! ðŸ˜‰

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
Heads up on **Service Changes and Interruptions**! We totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even completely stop parts or all of our services at any time â€“ and yeah, sometimes that might be without a heads-up. ðŸ˜¬ If, by some cosmic twist of fate (like force majeure, server hiccups, or a third-party service going down), content is temporarily unavailable, this site is **not on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
Okay, quick **Disclaimer**! ðŸš¨ The info this site dishes out is purely for your reference â€“ it's **not** professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). We're also **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just sayin'!

## 8. Governing Law
Let's talk **Governing Law**. These Terms of Service are basically ruled by and interpreted according to the laws of California, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ â€“ no funny business with conflicting laws here! If any disputes pop up because of or related to these terms, we'll first try to sort it out nicely through friendly negotiation. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Fair enough?

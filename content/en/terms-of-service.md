# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! üëã Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (let's call it "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to really read these Service Terms. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Quick Peek at Our Services
The Site provides users with cool paid subscription content and member services! Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and even community interaction, among other goodies. Heads up: some content is exclusively for our awesome subscribers.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- Users, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- You're totally responsible for your account's security and all activity happening under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account**, alright?
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach any of these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. All About Paid Subscriptions
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, and guess what? The fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises!
- All payments go through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Phew! The Site doesn't store your payment info.
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** ‚Äì unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends, of course.
- **Our Sweet 14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not absolutely thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-timer, sorry, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law specifically demands it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## 4. How You Can Use Our Content & Who Owns What
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! üö´ Unless you've got our explicit permission, don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes.
- Users, you're getting a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff, strictly for your personal learning and reading pleasure.
- Need it for commercial use or want to quote a lot? Shoot us a message to get authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it!

## 5. Play Nice! User Conduct Guidelines
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't.
- **Absolutely no** mass downloading, scraping, or cracking our member content using technical tricks. That's a big no-no!
- The Site has the right to remove any inappropriate content and **ban users who break the rules**. Consider yourself warned! üõ°Ô∏è

## 6. When Things Change or Go Sideways with Our Service
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how it is sometimes! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control‚Äîlike acts of God, server meltdowns, or third-party service interruptions‚Äîthe Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know!

## 7. Our Little Disclaimer
- The info we provide on the Site is strictly for your reference. It **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). So, don't make big decisions based solely on it, okay? üòâ
- The Site **ain't responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. The Law of the Land (aka Governing Law)
- These Service Terms are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. So, California rules! üå¥
- If any dispute pops up because of or related to these terms, we'll first try to sort it out amicably through friendly negotiation. If we can't hug it out, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

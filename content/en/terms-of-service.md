# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (also known as "the Site" or "we"). Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. Your decision to access or use the Site means you're totally on board with these terms. 👍

## 1. Service Overview
Our services, offered by the Site, include paid subscription content and exclusive member perks like blog posts, special resources, e-books, and community vibes. Heads up: some content is just for our subscribed users! ✨

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users, to register an account, just need to punch in a valid email address and whip up a password.
- Users are fully responsible for their account's security and everything that happens on it. So, passing your account around or sharing it? Absolutely **NOT** allowed! 🚫
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or even terminate** a user's account if they decide to break these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are usually billed monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact fees spelled out clearly on the checkout page.
- Payments are all handled through awesome third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.). We actually never store your payment info ourselves, so you're super safe! 🔒
- Subscriptions will **auto-renew** like clockwork, unless you hit that cancel button before your current billing cycle wraps up. 🗓️
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy is pretty cool**: If you're a first-time subscriber and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can totally snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) and tell us why you're bouncing. Oh, and this sweet deal is a one-time thing per user! Beyond 14 days, or if you've subscribed before, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law totally steps in.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content on the Site is **copyrighted by us (hubtoday)**! So, no copying, re-posting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so, alright? ✍️
- Users only snag a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right**, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, folks!
- Thinking about commercial use or dropping a ton of our quotes? Awesome! Just hit up the Site to get the green light first. ✅

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's a big fat **NO** to uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it! 🛑
- And another **NO**: Don't even think about using tech tricks to mass download, scrape, or hack our member content. That's just not cool! 😠
- The Site definitely has the right to yank down any inappropriate content and will totally **ban users who break the rules**. 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. Just keeping things flexible! 🔄
- The Site is absolutely **NOT liable for any compensation** if our content becomes temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Life happens, right? 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information we dish out on the Site is purely for your reference, and it **DOES NOT** count as professional advice of any kind (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). Just so we're clear! 💡
- The Site takes **NO responsibility whatsoever** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, buddy! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are all about the good ol' laws of the State of California, USA, and will be interpreted by them, totally ignoring any conflict of laws principles. Cali rules! 🇺🇸
- Any disputes that pop up from or are linked to these terms? We should totally try to sort them out with some friendly chats first. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California – they've got the final say! 🏛️

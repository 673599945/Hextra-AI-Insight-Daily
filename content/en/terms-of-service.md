# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll just call 'the Site' or 'us' from here on out). Before you dive in, please give these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using the Site, you're agreeing to them, simple as that.

## 1. About Our Services
So, what are we all about? **ai.hubtoday** offers users a sweet suite of paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, community vibes, and more. Heads up, though: some of the extra cool stuff is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **To get started**, you'll need to register an account by providing a valid email address and setting a password.
- **Your account security is on you!** You're responsible for keeping it safe and for all activity that happens under it. Oh, and absolutely **no transferring or sharing your account** ‚Äì that's a big no-no.
- **We reserve the right to step in.** If you violate these terms, we have the right to **suspend or terminate** your account. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Our subscription services** are billed monthly or annually. You'll see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises here!
- **All your payments** go through trusted third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **we never store your payment info** ourselves.
- **Your subscription will automatically renew**. Don't want it to? Just make sure you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our awesome 14-day refund policy** is here for first-time subscribers! üéâ If you're not happy with our service within 14 days of your purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're leaving. FYI: This is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if it's not your first subscription, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content is ¬© copyrighted by ai.hubtoday (that's us!).** So, no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without our say-so. Seriously, don't.
- **You get a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for your personal learning and reading pleasure. No sharing your access codes!
- **Need to use our stuff commercially or cite it heavily?** Just reach out to us for authorization first. We're usually pretty friendly! üòâ

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It's a definite no-go to upload, post, or spread** any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on someone else's rights. Let's keep it clean, folks!
- **Don't even think about bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking our member content** using any tech wizardry. We see you! üëÄ
- **We've got the right to remove any inappropriate content** and, yes, **ban users who don't play by the rules**. Consider this your fair warning!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We reserve the right to tweak, suspend, or totally stop parts or all of our services** whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the digital cookie crumbles sometimes.
- **We can't be held responsible for compensation** if our content goes temporarily offline due to things beyond our control‚Äîlike acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Life happens! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info we provide on the Site is strictly for reference only.** It's **not** professional advice of any kind ‚Äì so don't take it as financial, legal, medical, or any other kind of expert guidance.
- **We are absolutely not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA.** We're not messing with any conflict-of-law principles here.
- **Got a beef about these terms?** Let's try to sort it out amicably first! If friendly chats don't cut it, you agree to take any unresolved disputes to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Deal?

## 9. Get In Touch
- **Got questions about these terms?** No worries, just hit us up using the contact info below:
